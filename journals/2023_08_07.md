	- [[quote]] [[Nate Silver]] But considering that Twitter was already left-skewed, and that Trump was by far the most prominent exception, [banning Trump] further entrenched Twitter as a space for the Blob to talk amongst itself, without all the [deplorables](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-basket-of-deplorables.html) to get in the way. That’s why, to a certain type of progressive figure, it literally felt like Musk was [“opening the gates of hell”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/24/twitter-musk-reverses-suspensions/) when he unbanned Trump and other conservative accounts.
