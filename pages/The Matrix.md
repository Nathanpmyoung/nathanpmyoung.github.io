- [[Film]]
- I recall that all the colour was actually on set, rather than filters or editing.
- The film is so gritty
- Almost feels more real these days.
- Pretty long scenes
- The battery thing does't make sense but I guess it's hard to make AI need to keep humans around
- [[The Matrix]] [[Quote]]
	- "I thought you were a guy" "Most guys do"
	- "Welcome to the desert of the real"
	- "I know kung fu"
- Might be more interesting if the robots were just bored
- The graphics are fine even though they are bad. The real and graphics are well delineated
