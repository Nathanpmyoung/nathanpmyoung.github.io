- [[Film]]
- A lot of the colour is created by objects on set (though there was large colour grading 2008) [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEdgmNZnLs4)
- [[Dichotomy]]
	- Real vs Simulation
	- Fate vs Choice
	-
- The film is so gritty
- Almost feels more real these days.
- Pretty long scenes
- The battery thing does't make sense but I guess it's hard to make AI need to keep humans around
- [[The Matrix]] [[Quote]]
	- "I thought you were a guy" "Most guys do"
	- "Welcome to the desert of the real"
	- "I know kung fu"
	- "everything the body needs"
- Might be more interesting if the robots were just bored
- The graphics are fine even though they are bad. The real and graphics are well delineated
