	- Real vs [[Simulation]]
	- [[Fate]] vs Choice
	- Those fighting the system vs. those inside it
	- Dominance vs Submission
- The matrix seems to have aged well on [[AGI]] because it focuses primarily on an aspects which are still relevant - AI agents, choice, alignment, conflict, simulations.

	- "I thought you were a guy" "Most guys do"
	- "Welcome to the desert of the real"
	- "I know kung fu"
	- "everything the body needs"
- Thoughts while watching
	- The film is so gritty
	- Almost feels more real these days.
	- Pretty long scenes
	- The battery thing does't make sense but I guess it's hard to make AI need to keep humans around
	- Might be more interesting if the robots were just bored and so created the humans for that reason
	- The graphics are fine even though they are bad. The real and graphics are well delineated
- The film has been graded several times so it's hard to know what the film *should* look like [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEdgmNZnLs4)
