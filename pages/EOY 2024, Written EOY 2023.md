- [[Future Worlds]]
- *This was written at the end of 2023, to guess the world at the end of 2024. This is a set of forecasts, but it also a weak forecast on prioritisation. ie If I get all the facts right, but miss that aliens arrive, many forecasts would still give me a perfect score unless there was a question on aliens. This story would penalise me, however*
- # The median 2024
- Is AI first?
- Animal welfare
- Fusion power
- Space launches?
- World GDP
- Many little wars or not
- Genomics
- At the end of 2024 we will primarily feel either relaxation or shock, largely based on the 2024 Presidential Election. Probably either Biden or Trump will have won [^1] [^2]. Perhaps by the end of 2025 these futures will look more similar, but, since it was very close fought at the end of 2024, there is going to be a grieving on one side or the other.

- *Mostly I'm doing this to try and be good at prediction, but I think there is a community lobbying angle also. If we see how close some good worlds are to this one, then I think we could push for those worlds rather than the one I think we'll end up in.*
