- [[Song]] [[AI]]
- I made a song about [[Bryan Caplan]]'s concept of a "Beautiful Bubble". https://suno.com/song/3c4f930c-906e-4cc9-b7a1-552133da3421
- Here are the lyics:
	- Verse 1]
	  Amicably divorce
	  From society
	  Don't fight these people
	  Let it go 
	  Stop paying attention
	  To what frustrates you
	  Especially if you can't change it
	  The news is nothing but woe
	- [Verse 2]
	  Compare your life
	  To the poorest people
	  Compared to someone in Haiti
	  Your life is good
	  Take time to do the things you like
	  With the people you love
	  You always could
	- [Chorus]
	  Escape the noise
	  Let it fade away
	  It's gonna be okay (It's gonna be okay)
	  Just escape the noise
	  Let it fade away
	  Life is better this way (Life is better this way)
- Here are the steps I used:
- His article [Make Your Own Bubble In 10 Easy Steps](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2013/04/make_your_own_b.html) is a clear articulation of the thing I wanted to write about.
- I copied the article into [Claude.ai](https://claude.ai/) and asked it to write a summary of the article (GPT3/4 probably also works). I made any changes, cutting points I thought were less important.
- I asked Claude to make a song using this summary. This might seem lazy (it is) but it's great to get so quickly to the fun part.
- I went to [Suno](https://suno.com/create) and use the Custom mode where you can add lyrics. I initially messed around with high energy electronica, but I'd recommend using random style several times. I've also messed around with [Udio](https://www.udio.com/). It's hard to say which is better.
- I generated one song for each style.
- As I listened, I changed things about the lyrics that frustrated me.
- A rumba seemed to match this song and Bryan's vibe well. Something about the joy and cheekiness of it.
- I generated about 10 with small changes and took the one I liked best.
