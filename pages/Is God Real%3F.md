alias:: God is real

- This is a version of the thinking I did during my [[Deconversion]]. I've updated it to be accurate to what I think now
- # Assumptions
	- Assumptions. *I think it's good to be honest about the things you're taking for granted*
		- It's good to hold a position
			- I feel deep in my bones that we should attempt to have a position on everything important. I don't know if this is very important or entirely unimportant. Some people don't even consider taking a view. I don't really know what to think about that, but it's not me
		- The continuance of the universe
			- My general sense that the universe has existed in parallel with my life. That there is a past
			- If this is not the case, then any decisions I make, while they feel like they are based on experience, are not, because there is no past on which to base that experience
			- The universe could be a momentary dream which feels consistent.
			- I cannot think of a way to test this. [[Anthropics]]
		- The function of logic
			- That logic works. That A => B and B => C mean that A =>  C
			- If this is not the case, then decisions I make, however well argued will be meaningless
			- Logic could be fundamentally flawed, so the logic we design is irrelevant to the real world - like mathematics with different fundamental assumptions. It would suggest interesting things, but not tell us anything about our universe.
			- There is no way to argue out of this without using logic, which would not be a suitable proof in said universe
			- Without logic there is no discussion. Worshipping God is as worshipping the letter q
		- That suffering my suffering is bad and that my well being is good
			- Without this, I sort of don't know where to begin. Unrelated here, but I don't think anyone has a [[Moral Grounding]] for goodness.
- # We can't just presume or agree to disagree
	- That we can't just presume [[God]] is real (or false) the universe should actually be different in each case.
	- Many discussions boiled down to "some of us presume God is real, some don't, that's just the way it is"
		- Firstly, it determines whether [[Eternal Damnation]] is real, which seems pretty important
		- Secondly more assumptions are worse than fewer - they require more checking. Hence there are more possible errors to make
- # What does God add?
- It’s impossible to prove miracles don’t happen, but they are clearly exceedingly rare. I have never eaten a sandwich which turned into a frog and I guess I have eaten about 10 sandwiches a week since I was about 4 ( roughly 20 * 50 * 10= 10,000). If for the sake of argument one of my sandwiches had, that would still be a 1 in 10,000 occurrence. If one of my sandwiches wasn't where I left it, I would still assume I had misplaced it rather than the frog hypothesis. Not because it was impossible, but because it was less probable.
- The central argument is not about the impossibility of miracles (or of God), they are possible, but clearly they are improbable, we have few accounts of them happening, even if we trust those accounts. What is the additional evidence to make us think it was a sandwich turning into a frog, rather than just my forgetfulness or otherwise?
- ## That other people believe
- I surmise that most people's faith is strongly supported by many other people believing - s*omething can't be trivially wrong if many other people believe it, right?*
- So if God seems to be working in the lives of many people you like know and respect that in itself needs explaining.
	- But this is true of Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs. Why does this only mean Christianity is true?
- ## The Gospels
	- What is it in the gospels which is hard to explain? There are plenty of accounts/ stories which we do not consider to be divine/ inerrant.
	- Gospel accounts in an of themselves
		- They are 4 ~anonymous accounts, 40 - 60 years after some other event
			- I am almost aghast that I once considered this a proper argument. I would believe almost nothing on this evience
		- There *are* a lot of copies of the gospels. So we have pretty good evidence that they were what was originally written
			- Again, I struggle to understand the actual argument here. This doesn't make them more likely to be true
	- If there were an empty tomb Jewish opponents could have quelled it
		- No, that assumes the story was even spreading at the time. It's already more likely that the resurrection was a late addition than that it was a literal resurrection. If God wanted us to deduce this it's just very unlikely
		- Who would Jewish leaders have shown a body to?
		- Earliest jewish polemic presupposes stolen body
			- How early is this Jewish polemic. Look at accounts of the last 5 years. Polemic goes backwards and forwards.
	- Good moral advice
		- Do unto others as they would do unto you is found in Confuscious 500 bc (search 15:24) [http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Analects_of_Confucius_(Eno-2015).pdf](http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Analects_of_Confucius_(Eno-2015).pdf) and I don't see the Bible as far better than other texts
	- Miracles
		- There are other sources with miracles, too
		- Herodotus describes some miracles in his histories, note that he doubts them, but records them because he has been told them (37, 38) [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Herodotus_The_Persian_Wars_(Godley)/Book_VIII](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Herodotus_The_Persian_Wars_(Godley)/Book_VIII)
		- His doubting makes an even stronger case, he acknowledges the strangeness of what he records but does it anyway. A true believer would be more likely to record things he wanted to be true.
		- So should we believe these miracles happened? I don't think many Christians do? I imagine they might say "I don't have other reasons to these believe". If anything, it sounds like the miracles are using up credence rather than providing it - they are an anchor, not a lifejacket
	- His burial
		- After his death he was buried in a tomb by Joseph of arimithea
		- This is only evidence for his death
		- Why would they paint a Jewish leaded in such a good light?
	- Other
		- Guard at tomb suggests jews said there was no body
		- No evidence that the body (if it was left) was used for necromancy or healing etc
		- The Unfortunate nature of the stories suggests they are true?
			- But Jesus triumphs
		- The clueless nature of the disciples feels readl
			- This is a literary device like the crew in the odyssey
		- Characters in odyssey are fictional, but Peter and disciples were known church leaders
			- Literary devices can apply to both real and fake people. Non-fictional works contain literary devices.
		- A resurrected saviour is a very novel idea
			- Other similar death and resurrection cults
			- Osiris physical resurrection on walls of pyramid
			- Daniel, Isiah, Wisdom of solomon, gabriel inscription all suggest death and resurrection of messiah
- ## The Epistles
	- Paul sharply changes his mind
		- Many people do
	- Paul claims to have seen a vision
		- There is significant literature on hallucinations, we do not believe them to be miraculous or to point to any specific god
			- Note Paul does not claim to have seen Jesus alive (other than in visions), nor that the gospel he teaches comes from people who have, he specifically claims his Gospel is not from men and that he preached for 3 years before he met anyone who we think (cause he doesn’t say) saw Jesus in the flesh
	- Does Paul think Jesus was a real person?
		- He doesn’t suggest anyone saw jesus in a different way-
		- Romans 16:25-26 Only revelation and scripture
		- Born of woman
		- 1 Thessalonians 2:14-16
		- This is possibly dubious, given it is far more antisemitic than the rest of Paul’s writing and fits being added after the destruction of the temple
- ## Acts
	- The empty tomb
	- Speeches
		- These are often made up in ancient histories
	- Resurrection
	- No mention in acts of any search for missing body/investigation
- ## The Growth of the Church
	- Mormonism, a faith with a frankly ludicrous (as I understand it) grounding is currently growing faster than Christianity did to begin with [http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=95#identifier_4_95](http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=95#identifier_4_95)
	- Not entirely comparable given opportunities of the information age
- ## The Deaths of the Disciples
	- Is there any historical evidence for this, and that they didn’t recant and that if they had recanted they expected not to die?
- ## Philosophical
- I am not interested in argument which do no provide for a deity
  Cosmological arguments - who created the universe
- -
- I do not see this as intrinsically more convincing than infinite regress. Both are entirely untestable
- -
- It involves special pleading. A god is only the solution to the problem because it is the solution to the problem
- -
- I don’t think that since everything we have seen has a cause, this implies that all things have a cause (Indeed. Causality requires time. It is no longer clear in physics that causality is fundamental.)
  Teleological - arguments based on structure
- -
- Arguments from consciousness
- -
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_consciousness)
- -
- These require dualism, that there is something non-physical about the mind
- -
- If minds are solely material how can the thoughts they think be true?
- -
- Well if they aren’t, tough luck. This doesn’t mean that minds aren’t material
- -
- -
- Counter arguments
- -
  From physics - conservation of momentum
- -
  Brain damage - when the brain is damaged so is the mind
- -
  Neuroscience - decision can be predicted before poeple say they’ve made them
- -
  Simplicity - why is this necessary
- The fine-tuning argument
- -
- Our universe requires a very specific set of variables to exist. Were it any other way there would be no universe. This implies something which set those variables the way they are
- -
- Does this imply God? No, it implies something. Maybe a multiverse (Many multiverses have been plausibly posited for reasons that have nothing to do with fine-tuning.)
- -
- It’s only notable if physics can’t prove, it’s worth waiting
- -
- Higher order explanations
- -
- String theory
- -
- Multiverse
- -
- Maximal multiverse
- -
- Life permitting
- -
- Collapse after x
- -
- The current state of the universe is very unlikely
- -
- Positivism
- -
- A/B theory of time
- -
- Past memories
- -
- Philosophical Community not impressed by positivism
- -
- Arguments against theism
- -
- What is the tool which show we are
- -
- Brute force
- -
- (lots of attempts)
- -
- Mechanism
- -
- Discernment
- -
- Evolution
- -
- Teleological towards good
- -
- Nominalism and objectivism mathematics
- The likelihood principle
- -
- If something makes something more likely it can be used as evidence for that thing
- -
- Surely by above use likelihood principle the existence of any object can make any correctly defined hypothetical object more likely? The existence of a Ford Transit Van (0) is likely with unicorns with the intent to create Transit Vans (A) and less likely assuming the absence of such unicorns (B). Hence Ford Transit Vans are evidence for unicorns. We know unicorns are not real and yet this argument suggests they are made more likely by Transit Vans therefore it is a flawed argument.
- -
- Perhaps it is more likely, but that doesn’t make it “likely”. We could have gone from 0.0000001 to 0.0000002. More importantly we don’t know and can’t find out.
- -
- Can we talk about probability in relation to god, when there are no existent alternatives and there is only one shot, one opportunity
- Complexity
- -
- Are organisms too complex to have evolved?
- -
- What about errors/ vestigial bits
- -
- If life is too complex is not a deity significantly more complex and unlikely?
- Simplicity and trustworthiness
- -
- Simple explanations are usually true
- -
- Reasons to doubt your experiences:
- -
- Something very unlikely is claimed
- -
- How do we discuss the unlikelihood of God?
- -
- Something more likely is possible
- -
- You are unreliable
- -
- You are in a situation in which you are unreliable
- -
- Basic beliefs
- -
- Some beliefs are held without evidence e.g. that other people have minds
- -
- I have evidence of this. I interact with people and they seem self conscious. That’s evidence
- Hunger satisfaction
- -
  Hunger proves the existence of food - does it?
- -
- Hunger for eternity proves the existence of eternity
- ## Miracles
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFX_PgzJZk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhFX_PgzJZk)
- -
- do miracles happen as a result of God?
- -
- How unlikely should a miracle be?
- -
- Or can there just be a lack of evidence for the non miraculous? Or events so unlikely that they are in turn miraculous?
- -
- Can we ever prove miracles or will it always be possible to suggest unlikely but possible getarounds (people went insane, wishful thinking etc)
- -
- Does this philosophical groundwork kill the possibility of miracles?
- ## Evidence of Writing Preceding Events it Describes
- ## Personal Experience
- ## God’s Ways are Higher than Our Ways
- So are Allah’s but you don’t dismiss all the inconsistencies within the Qu’ran on this basis. Indeed all criticisms of all gods should be ignorable due to this.
- It is unfalsifiable.
- Surely there needs to be some reason to initially trust God before allowing this defence. I have yet to find one.
- ## If at this point there is not a convincing point, we already have an issue.
- # Things which make the Bible less likely
- ## Inconsistencies within the Bible

	- In a formal logical system, a *single* contradiction is disastrous. See: the [principle of explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion). If we can find a single contradiction in the bible its is a free for all. Anything can be true.
		- Lemons are yellow
		- So the statement (Lemons are yellow OR Unicorns live in Britain) is TRUE
		- But if we have a contradiction - ie that Lemons are both yellow AND Lemons are NOT yellow
		- Then using the above TRUE statement one of the parts of the OR statement must be true. If Lemons are NOT yellow, then Unicorns live in Britain
	- If the Bible didn't claim inerrancy, this wouldn't be a problem. We'd just think "there must be an error elsewhere". But the Bible makes a lot of Big claims that have to be taken on trust. If there are random errors around, where are they? Maybe God isn't actually all powerful. Maybe Hell isn't real?
	- ### My Current top 3 inconsistencies
	  collapsed:: true
		- What are the movements of Jesus family at his birth?
			- [MT 2:1-16](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Matthew+2:13-16)
				- Mary and Joseph live in Bethlehem, there is no reason to believe otherwise.
				- Following the birth of Jesus, Joseph and Mary flee to Egypt, (where they stay until after Herod's death) in order to avoid the murder of their firstborn by Herod.
				- Herod slaughters all male infants two years old and under.
				- In order to avoid the issue that Josephus doesn’t mention Herod having killed loads of children, it is agreed by every Christian I have heard that Herod only kills babies in Bethlehem and surrounding area
				- The implication, from verse 7 is that this us some time after the birth, since herod asks the exact time the star rose, so Mary and Joseph have lived in bethlehem some time, in fact, Herod estimates up to two years (though he might have a margin for error).
			- [LK 2:22-40](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Luke+2:22-40)
				- Following the birth of Jesus, Joseph and Mary remain in the area of Jerusalem for the Presentation (about forty days) and then return to Nazareth without ever going to Egypt.
				- No mention of Egypt, no mention of killing babies. In Luke, Bethlehem is just for the census after which they return to Nazareth, Joseph’s town
			- How do these two accounts line up? Do the authors just each mysteriously miss out huge chunks of reality? If so, is the Bible doing this in 100s of other places too? Is the straightforward reading of those passages wrong also?
		- How many children does Michal have?
			- [2SA 6:23](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=2+Samuel+6:23) Michal was childless until the day of her death
			- [2SA 21:8](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=2+Samuel+21:8) (KJV) She had five sons.
			- The majority of hebrew have this, but not some Hebrew or the Septuagint (presumably because they spotted the error)
		- Loads of Contradictions in Kings/Chronicles
			- [1KI 4:26](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=1+Kings+4:26) Solomon had 40,000 horses (or stalls for horses).
			- [2CH 9:25](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=2+Chronicles+9:25) He had 4,000 horses (or stalls for horses).
			- [1KI 7:15-22](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=1+Kings+7:15-22) The two pillars were 18 cubits high.
			- [2CH 3:15-17](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=2+Chronicles+3:15-17) They were 35 cubits high.
	- Surely I can argue that the anti-homosexuality passages in the bible are possibly a series of copyist errors or misunderstandings or deliberate changes? Or what about the teachings on women?
	- ### Other Contradictions - I suggest go to next point
- Two different contradictory creation accounts
- Jehovah not know before moses but actually known
- -
- Exodus 6:2-3 King James Version (KJV) 2 And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord:3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.
- -
- Genesis 22:14-16 King James Version (KJV) 14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
- 120 Years
- -
- [GE 6:3](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+6:3) The Lord said, "My spirit will not be in man forever, for he is only flesh; so the days of his life will be a hundred and twenty years."
- -
- Only a generalising statement?
- -
- So we ought not to take God’s words literally? That’s a dangerous precedent.
- -
- And is it definitely addressing issue of lifespan?
- -
- I am everywhere using respected english translations (often translated for believers so if there is bias it’s probably the other way). If it isn’t lifespan the onus is on the disagreer to saying what it is.
- -
- [GE 9:29](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+9:29) Noah lived nine hundred and fifty years.
- Wedding at Cana
- -
- [MT 4:1-11](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Matthew+4:1-11), [MK 1:12-13](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Mark+1:12-13) Immediately following his Baptism, Jesus spent forty days in the wilderness resisting temptation by the Devil.
- -
- [JN 2:1-11](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=John+2:1-11) Three days after the Baptism, Jesus was at the wedding in Cana.
- -
- It makes sense for John to be talking retrospectively
- -
- Sure, but it’s not the natural reading
- -
- John often alters chronology to make theological points
- -
- How do we know he doesn’t alter other things or add in miracles to make theological points? How can we trust links to prophesy if he fiddles other details
- God repents
- -
- Literally the same word [https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_5162.htm](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/strongs_5162.htm)
- -
- Numbers 23:19-20 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?
- -
- 1 Samuel 15:29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.
- -
- Exodus 32:14 King James Version (KJV) And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.
- -
- Genesis 6:6 King James Version (KJV) And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
- -
- 1 Samuel 15:35 King James Version (KJV) And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
- When does Noah go into the ark?
- -
- [GE 7:7](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+7:7) Noah and his clan enter the Ark.
- -
- [GE 7:13](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+7:13) They enter the Ark (again?).
- How old was abraham when his father died?
- -
- [GE 11:26](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+11:26) Terah was 70 years old when his son Abram was born.
- -
- [GE 11:32](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+11:32) Terah was 205 years old when he died (making Abram 135 at the time).
- -
- [GE 12:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+12:4), [AC 7:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Acts+7:4) Abram was 75 when he left Haran. This was after Terah died. Thus, Terah could have been no more than 145 when he died; or Abram was only 75 years old after he had lived 135 years.
- -
- Perhaps Arram was the third son but this is pretty unclear
- Jehovah not know before moses but actually known
- -
- Exodus 6:2-3 King James Version (KJV): And God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord: 3 And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them.
- -
- Genesis 22:14-16 King James Version (KJV): 14 And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be seen.
- Tyre
- -
- [EZ 26:7-21](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Ezekiel+26:15-21) God says that Tyre will be destroyed and will never be found again.
- -
- (Nebudchanezzar failed to capture or destroy Tyre. It is still inhabited.)
- -
- [https://www.ancient.eu/Tyre/](https://www.ancient.eu/Tyre/)
- -
- [http://www.aboutbibleprophecy.com/q31.htm](http://www.aboutbibleprophecy.com/q31.htm)
- Incest
- -
- “And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter…it is a wicked thing….” — Leviticus 20:17
- -
- [But what was god’s reaction to Abraham, who married his sister — his father’s daughter?] See Genesis 20:11-12
- -
- “And God said unto Abraham, As for Sara thy wife…I bless her, and give thee a son also of her…” — Genesis 17:15-16
- -
- Abraham is not shows as exemplary
- -
- There is no condemnation of grave sexual immorality. This is at best very unclear
- ## Historical/Factual inconsistencies
- ### Creation
- The bible gives the impression that creatures are created in “Kinds” this is not the case
- God calls the expanse above “heaven” and the water above is above that
- What evidence is there for the flood.
- -
- Babylonian flood
- -
  This is not what the story tells though - it requires fudging to turn a worldwide flood (for which is there is no evidence) to al localised one. Which would not have covered all the “high mountains under the entire heavens”” to a depth of 6.8 meters. This is inconsistent
- Things that die
- -
- “Everything that is on the earth shall die” This seems pretty unequivocal.
- -
- Local area?
- -
- Gen 7 17-24 The flood continued forty days on the earth. The waters increased and bore up the ark, and it rose high above the earth. The waters prevailed and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the face of the waters. And the waters prevailed so mightily on the earth that **all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered**. The waters prevailed above the mountains, **covering them fifteen cubits deep**. And **all flesh died that moved on the earth, birds, livestock, beasts, all swarming creatures that swarm on the earth, and all mankind. Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died. He blotted out every living thing that was on the face of the ground, man and animals and creeping things and birds of the heavens**. They were blotted out from the earth. **Only Noah was left**, and those who were with him in the ark. And the waters prevailed on the earth 150 days.
- -
- There isn’t a lot of wiggle room to suggest that only some things died or that it was localised unless living things were localised too which we know isn’t true
- -
- [GE 6:4](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+6:4) There were Nephilim (giants) before the Flood.
- -
- [GE 7:21](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+7:21) All creatures other than Noah and his clan were annihilated by the Flood. See above
- -
- [NU 13:33](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Numbers+13:33) There were Nephilim after the Flood.
- Evidence of the garden of eden
- ### Events
- Does the bible describe any events wrong
- We can now answer the questions in job
- Evidence for exodus?
- Evidence for resurrection of the dead at resurrection of Jesus
- Darkness
- Barabbas
- Implausible character
- Egypt governer released guy (src?)
- Not on jewish holiday
- Not a traitor or a murderer
- Far to closely matches yom kippur
- Fake sounding name
- Not impossible
- Implausibly convenient story structure
- Jesus teaches on reversals
- James and John replaced by convicts at right and left
- Simon Peter replaced by simon of cirene
- Jews mock and centurion notes
- Women report resurrection
- Mark constructs cross from psalm
- Why does mark miss piercing of hands and feet
- What about events for which there is no parallel
- Perhaps mark references psalm in light of events
- Do later gospels change events
- Romulus/ Jesus road story
- Reification of imaginary people into real people
- Lazarus fictional character who becomes real
- Is he disciple who jesus loves?
- Hugely implausible events no one else mentioned
- Darkness over the land
- Mass resurrection
- ## Moral Inconsistencies and Issues
- We are punished (by having to sin and hence being punished for that) for Adam’s sin, despite having no part in it.
- -
- Outside of a moral system which justifies it, this would not be something we believe
- -
- I should not be held responsible for Adam's sin, that’s an unjust system
- -
- It links to shame and family honour, systems we have since discarded
- -
- I had no ability to affect adam’s actions so why am I being punished for them? I do not deserve the punishment
- -
- Note that the Bible agrees on both sides, leading to another inconsistency
- -
- “The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father…” — Ezekiel 18:20
- -
- “I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation…” — Exodus 20:5
- -
- My failure to follow God’s law is my fault, despite the fact that I would never be able to, and I am unable to because of adam’s sin.
- -
- All people are created for hell and have no other natural alternative, this is not justice.
- -
- All people are created for hell
- -
- Hell is created for the devil / demons.. Mt 25:41
- -
- This isn't it a counterpoint. Hell can be created for demons and humanity can be created to (without God’s help) go to hell.
- -
- “All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” Romans 3:23
- -
- “What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory— even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?”
- -
- Those to which God has not prepared for mercy may be prepared for destruction. If all have sinned, as above, the natural end for all is hell and destruction
- -
- This statement isn’t exhaustive
- -
- If this statement were exhaustive, it would still be fudgeable by the same logic which allows many literal things Jesus says to be taken to mean slightly wider things that their most literal interpretation
- -
- Like what?
- -
- No natural alternative
- -
- God’s presence
- -
- This is not a natural alternative. No human can attain heaven without being predestined by God.

- “For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.” Romans 8
- -
- “For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—  not by works, so that no one can boast.” Ephesians 2:8-9
- -
- It is not by natural actions (works) but by grace we are saved. There is no natural way a human could avoid hell.
- -
- Justice
- -
- Justice is (off the top of my head) the appropriate punishment for wrongdoing. Or as the stanford dictionary of philosophy puts it “the constant and perpetual will to render to each his due”.
- -
- Wrongdoing requires an element of choice. What is “his due” if he had no choice in the matter?
- -
- Wikipidia: Usually, to be classified as a crime, the "act of doing something criminal" (actus reus) must – with certain exceptions – be accompanied by the "intention to do something criminal" (mens rea). Can there be an intention to do wrong if there were not alternatives?
- -
  Maybe - if you have a choice between killing one person or another (with no other choices) you could still intend to kill one
- -
- If we could not have acted any other way, how can we be punished for our choices?
- -
- Would we punish a child who we forced to commit a crime?
- -
- And the Bible agrees, it argues that there are choices between good and bad
- -
- Deut 30: 15-20 “See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil… Therefore choose life, that you and your offspring may live, loving the LORD your God, obeying his voice and holding fast to him”
- -
- Prov. 1 Wisdom: “Then they will call to me but I will not answer;    they will look for me but will not find me, since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the Lord.”
- -
- How many sermons have I heard even as a calvinist, which suggest we should choose to do that which is good?
- -
- God’s forbearance in Jesus then, is hardly mercy then when the alternative was not justice
- -
- To Romans 9, “Shall what is formed say to the one who formed it “why did you make me like this?”” Yes, I shall
- -
- If I made a conscious cracked pot and then tortured it for being cracked, that would be on me, (unless there were other reasons to believe my justice)
- Temptation
- -
- “Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.” — James 1:13
- -
- “And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham…” — Genesis 22:1
- The problem of evil
- -
- How can God be good, all powerful and all knowing while there is suffering
- -
- Unless sin and humanity’s ultimate punishment are good.
- -
- If God is all powerful and good **why does evil exist**
- -
- Gives space for man’s free will
- -
- What Biblical evidence is there for free will as a concept in the Bible
- -
- If there was free will, how come all fall short of the Glory of God? That seems more like a failure of design.
- -
- God must have created the Devil and made him fall, perhaps by inaction.
- -
- God created Adam and Eve knowing they would sin and allowed them to sin
- -
- Humanity is therefore unable not to sin and held personally responsible as a result of God’s action/inaction
- -
- How is God** good here**?
- The position of women, 1 Cor 15
- God is love
- -
- **Love does not keep a record of wrongs**
- -
- God does. God is vengeful but that is good
- Fruti of the Spirit
- -
- **Many of these actions are unlike God/Israelits in OT**
  Gods presence - cant’ dwell with poeple. Cain leaves it suggesting adam even in it despite their sin.
  God isn’t all loving - **he didn’t love Esau** which is used to justify him not loving many others **The OT god is very much like all the other gods humans have invented**
- Confusion
- -
- [GE 11:9](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+11:9) At Babel, the Lord confused the language of the whole world.
- -
- [1CO 14:33](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=1+Corinthians+14:33) Paul says that God is not the author of confusion.
- -
- This is in the context of orderly worship
- -
- But it is a piece of evidence, not a conclusion “for God is…” So it is saying God is not the author of confusion
- So we are called never to sin whatever the circumstances but God can, does that not encourage utilitarianism of the sort that encourages genocide etc. Surely if God were inflexible on right and wrong that would be better.
- Is God Omnipotent?
- -
- [GE 17:1](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+17:1), [35:11](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Genesis+35:11), [1CH 29:11-12](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=1+Chronicles+29:11-12), [LK 1:37](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Luke+1:37) God is omnipotent. Nothing is impossible with (or for) God.
- -
- [JG 1:19](http://www.biblegateway.com/bible?&version=KJV&passage=Judges+1:19) Although God was with Judah, together they could not defeat the plainsmen because the latter had iron chariots.
- How do we explain the differing creation narratives, why was death always a part of the garden
- ## Scientific Errors and False Strong Implications
- ## Philosophical
- The Bible accounts are exactly what you would expect of a human made religion
- Religion has clear reasons for having been “invented” and for surviving
- -
- People like religions. They make them up all the time
- -
- Maybe they based on truth
- -
- This isn’t falsifiable
- -
- It gave diving authority to Kings and controlled people
- The human mind has a need to create God
- -
- Shared rituals of initiation and life help create a sense of **shared society and community**
- Religious experience can be mapped to physical phenomena
- The existence of an all powerful being is even less likely than the existence of our universe
- ## Abusive systems of thought
- Does Christianity encourage us to be rational?
- -
- Does it encourage us to search for the answers
- Faith is unfalsfiable and exactly the kind of system you would invent to require less evidence
- ## Other inconsistencies/ issues
- Many Scholars consider 2 Peter Pseudographical
- -
- This book affirms that paul’s writing is scripture
- # Specific Responses
- ## But there couldn’t be that much evidence from Biblical times
- Also what were their standards
- ## Here are my reasons for Jesus
- This is a quote I read from a review. I think breaking down may be instructive:
- For myself, I believe in the claims of Jesus Christ for two reasons. Firstly, I believe because I find the Bible to be authoritative and historically accurate. I find it to be authoritative in what it says about me, others and this world. Within the full story of the Bible most, if not all, of life is touched upon in a profound way which leads me to believe it is divinely inspired. I find it historically accurate because the life, crucifixion, empty tomb and eye witness testimonies to the resurrection of Jesus are all recognised as historical facts. These core beliefs are defended by historians. Secondly, I believe because of experiences. I have experienced that when I pray, things tend to work out better, and that when I read the Bible, I am filled with joy. I have experienced that when I live my life for God and not for me, extraordinary things are possible. I have experienced God changing me and giving me freedom to become a unique individual. These two pillars, the Bible and my experiences, are enough for me to believe in the claims of Jesus Christ. It’s a shame that Sam Harris doesn’t seem open to really considering the evidence.
