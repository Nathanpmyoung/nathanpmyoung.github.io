	- In novels, my favorite bar none is Mo Dao Zu Shi by Mo Xiang Tong Xiu: it really transcends the romance genre with characterization work as good as Bujold's and thoughtful exploration of the way power corrupts. The last book in the series is just painful to read. But I've also really been enjoying Rou Bao Bu Chi Rou's novels recently, which are a bit lighter and fluffier (not to mention hornier), typically with Lawful Good/Chaotic Evil pairings. In Western fiction, I really liked Xiran Jay Zhao's Iron Widow: canonical poly ship between two of the most feral violent traumatized mecha pilots imaginable and their morality pet/voice of reason.
	- There have been some fantastic TV shows coming out of Thailand. My absolute favorite is Manner of Death, which is a romantic suspense show. It has some wonky camera/sound stuff because Thai TV has zero budget, but the actors playing the main pairing have absolutely scintillating chemistry like I've never seen between another couple. Kinnporsche is the Thai TV show which is most popular overseas, although I would say it is more... niche... it's a twelve-episode experiment in how close you can get to pornography on Thai TV at 11pm.
