Equilibria.md

- Free speech
  - Free speech (US)
  - <- I think I'd want to be about hereish. Free speech but Nazism is bad.
  - Mild to moderate censorship (UK Police bothering random people for social media posts)
  - Strong censorship (China)
  - No free speech (North Korea)
- LGBT+ stuff
  - Full transgenderism (Netherlands?)
  - No child transition (UK) <- Probably given the failure of pro-trans orgs to run research to show that trans surgeries are effective, I go here.
  - LGB but not the T (US)
  - No LGBT+ (Russia)
- Housebuilding
  - State planned (Dubai)
  - Relatively free zoning (Texas?) <- I am here but unsure how stable this equilibrium is if there were loads of housing build and people got overwhelmed
  - Local planning and no housing (UK/California)
- Immigration
  - Open borders (Sweden)
  - Open borders but with limits (Canada) <- So far, this seems pretty responsible with high immigration and reasonable public trust
  - No immigration (Australia)
- Healthcare

  - Non-existent in wealthy countries, the poor just suffer
    - You might think the US does this, but actually the US still has emergency rooms, hugely subsidised by the state. In my view a lot of their 'not caring' is more expensive than if they cared in a coherent way.

- Note how some positions don't seem to have equilibria. You choose between two bad positions.
