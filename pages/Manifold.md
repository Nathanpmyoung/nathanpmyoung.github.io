- In terms of incentives, manifold pay almost their entire "willingness to pay" for new signups in the signup bonus ($2.50). It's in their fake currency, but they hope that one day it will be real money. I guess that's a double incentive to their users.
- The pivot
	- There only current outgoing is donations, where all the amount donated [$220k](https://manifold.markets/charity) is far less than the amount they have backed by [$500k](https://manifoldmarkets.notion.site/Charitable-donation-program-668d55f4ded147cf8cf1282a007fb005).
		- They aren't currently in any trouble at all. This isn't a run on the bank scenario.
	- They have currently printed [$1.2 mn in mana against total assets of $1.5mn](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SM3YzTsXmQ6BaFcsL/you-probably-want-to-donate-any-manifold-currency-this-week?commentId=3Nb8RqesQaqBjBnsM). This doesn't leave them with much runway for salaries.
		- To what extent was it expected that 100 mana would stay worth 1$? And so to what extent were they previously spending money they didn't have (for which they should be punished)
			- Austin took his $100k salary in mana as a way of being incentivised for it to have real world value.
		- This could be existential for manifold, if this fails they might not exist.
			- Maybe, but if that's the case:
				- They could say so
				- They could sell more stock
		- It seems unlikely that everyone will change mana straight into assets to remove. People like the site and like betting on it. Being able to take money out is a reason to invest more, not less
	- Having to make decisions in a week is annoying.
