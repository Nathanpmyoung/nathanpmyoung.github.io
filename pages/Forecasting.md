aliases:: Forecast, Forecasts

- Takes
	- It's about forecasters not about forecasting - *The main thing one learns from forecasting is who the good forecasters are. Listening to them is the value add*
	- Few decisions have been changed due to forecasting
- Things I do that it's hard to get paid for. Please [[Contact]] me if you want to pay for this work
	- Big plays - I've spoken to [[The Social Media Platform Formerly Knows As Twitter]] about using prediction markets in Community Notes. There is perhaps a 1% chance this runs on twitter at scale, but that is very valuable. I guess it has taken several weeks of my focus plus the initial tweets (many similar such tweets fail)
	- Connecting people - Recently the [[X]] Community Notes team to various players in forecasting, but previously people to Robin Hanson, or suggesting ideas or connecting EA's to one another.
	- Impactful question generation - I don't think I've delivered here yet at this but I'm working on it. It is a hard problem.
	- Building forecasting tech prototypes to understand what works - I have found some dead ends (question generation and forecast visualisation). The problem is that it's hard to protect the work I do in creating this stuff. If I build a great question generation flow (which I have some ideas for) companies seem pretty unwilling to pay for the knowledge that I learned in doing this.
