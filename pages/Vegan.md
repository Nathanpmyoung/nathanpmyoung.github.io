alias:: Veganism, Fake Meat

- My main difficulty with being vegan is when I am [[Sad]]
	- Hard to tell if it is causal
- Veganism is good. And it's good to no be involved with the animal suffering industrial complex. But it's not a particularly effective way to do so (or not more than a couple of months a year to remind me what it feels like)
- While I am vegan I am stressed for about an hour a day figuring out what I'm going to eat. I can't cook well enough to have variety and my friends keep warning me I am damaging my health.
- I could *learn* to cook as a vegan but that's a much clearer use of time that I could use elsewhere.
- Good fake meat
	- Those quorn slices
	- [[Squeaky Bean]]
	- Tesco own brand pizza
	- White rabbit (?) pizza
	- Lazy vegan meals
		- Not the risotto
