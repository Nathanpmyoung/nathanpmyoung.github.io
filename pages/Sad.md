- I have depressive moods, there is some depression in my family. I don't consider myself to have depression, though tests usually find I have moderate depression. *Brutal*
- For me, sadness is a resistance in all I do. Not wanting to get up, not wanting to see people.
- Relatedly it's not uncommon for it to take 90 minutes for me to leave the house to go see a friend
- Often I need to check whether I am [[Hungry]] or [[Underslept]] (see [[Order]])
