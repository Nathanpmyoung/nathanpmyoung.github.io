- It's really annoying having someone tell you what is good for you. Especially based on their own experience. In this position someone is almost never claiming to have interviewed 10 people or considered the problem for some time. Instead they have their pet theory and now am are the next person for whom it's a great fit.
- But I have the answer! You should..
  
  You should nothing. Instead, I'll tell you that I find it much better when someone couches there experiences in the first person. Rather than telling you what you should do, I try to talk about what I have experienced, what seemed to work for me, how I felt.
- I think this is better because it implicitly brings in many caveats one would want to give. It's clear that this has worked for me, and might not for you. It's clear that if you are more similar to me it probably will work better. It's clear this is a sample size of 1.
