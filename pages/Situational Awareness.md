- What parts of this could be turned into predictions?
	- "We are racing through the OOMs extremely rapidly, and the numbers indicate we should expect another ~100,000x effective compute scaleup—resulting in another GPT-2-to-GPT-4-sized qualitative jump—over four years"
	- What does it mean to have "models as smart as PhDs or experts that can work beside us as coworkers"
- Notes
	- Seems to underrate
		- Multiple counting
		- Separate labs slowing down
		- Processese that can't happen in parallel (learning from big runs, improving AI agents)
		- Regulation
		- Improving humans
		- Compute for running models, not agents
