	- Yes, both are
- If I use a transporter is that okay

- Should I save money for myself tomorrow?
	- Every other person would be confused, but happy to receive the money, why should I give it to [[Nathan Young]] tomorrow?

	- Well I like being alive
- Why is the continuance of this particular consciousness so important to me
	- If I were a different one then I'd think differently

	- I also want good things for everyone else too
