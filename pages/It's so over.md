- I was musing about emulated minds, and how, even with technology, one day every copy of mine may become too fine-tuned for whatever useful work can pay for its existence.
- I felt sad
- I like being alive. I like understanding and solving problems. And the idea that one day, against my will, even having scaled the whole tech tree, I might not be able to continue doing that. It seemed kind of tragic.
- Likely death will get me before then, sure, but death is an old enemy. I know he will one day fall. If not in my lifetime then those of my children. But to find I've beaten death, but not some deeper decay. That feels worse, somehow.
- That said, [[Problems are solvable]]. Is there some way for me to feel like me even while my mind is being reset?
