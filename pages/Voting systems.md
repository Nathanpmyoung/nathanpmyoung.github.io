- Little bits of research by country
	- UK
		- Government stay in power for a long time, are always able to get bills through.
		- Doesn't seem like competent governance
	- US
		- 2-4 year periods where the executive can't pass legislation but isn't removed
		- Is actually a competent country
	- New Zealand
		- 1 Kiwi I know likes it
	- German
		- Currently really struggling, in a very predictable way (not enough energy)
- Does [[Tactical Voting]] lessen the need for voting change
