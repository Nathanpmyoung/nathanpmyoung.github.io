- Forecasts provide a valuable source of information
- Betting is a legitimate means of forecasting
- Betting does not mean that those betting don't take it seriously
- Forecasting ugly outcomes is generally taxed way to high by our culture

- Betting on war is often good, as it currently exists. This isn't a motte and bailey. I'm not going to talk about idealised betting in an idealised world. I mean that the current setup is good and beneficial.
- I'll start with my strongest argument.
	- Just want to say that I moved from Kyiv to Lviv on Feb 13 /entirely/ thanks to this prediction thread and the Metaculus estimates. (Still in Lviv but leaving Ukraine later today.)
	- It’s hard to estimate the impact, but at the very least I have saved myself an enormous hassle trying to move all my possessions, finding an apartment in Lviv, etc on very short notice — which would have happened otherwise. Of course, worse outcomes were possible too if things had played out a bit differently.
- A forecast on the Ukraine invasion allowed availablegreen (I guess a young man) to leave his home and make better choices than he would otherwise have done. Had the invasion gone much worse for Ukraine, it could have saved him a much more traumatic experience.
- Whatever we think the costs of war betting are, this is one of the benefits. An actual person was saved a huge amount of trouble.

- If you like examples, I have put more at the end. But let's now make the more robust case. It has 3 points:
	- Forecasts provide a valuable source of information
	- Betting is a legitimate means of forecasting
	- Betting does not mean that those betting don't take it seriously
