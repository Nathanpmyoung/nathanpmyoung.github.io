- I don't think scholars take this very seriously but I think it's underrate. A big chunk of Biblical scholars seem to be [[Evangelical Christian]]s with reason to think that [[Jesus]] lived as described.
- I wouldn't be surprised if in a few 100 years we take a more "who knows" approach.
- That's not to say that there was no person named Jesus, but instead that the majority of Jesus myths aren't about the same person.
	- Perhaps there were multiple teachers
	- Perhaps many stories were made up of whole cloth
		- Since the stories already involve miracles, which seem unlikely to me, I don't understand why we should think all the other scholarship is pristine. Maybe there was a lot of hearsay.
	- It starts with Paul
		- Richard Carrier - who I sense isn't that trustworthy in general - advances a theory that Jesus starts with Pauline Epistles (the earlier works) and that the gospels are written later. *Maybe this is just general scholarship, I can't remember*.
		- I find this pretty plausible. Since the gospels come afterwards, who knows what the oral history was before Paul. And since his works are so dense and theological they could have changed the works significantly
		- Carrier argues that Paul only once unambiguously claims Jesus was a physical historical person. *I dunno man*
- Mainly I think people say "well obviously Jesus lived" but this seems to grant too much credit. I think obviously Muhammad lived as we generally understand it, but Jesus I'm less sure of. His birth stories are so different and wild that I'm not sure we should be clear on them, much of his ministry could be stories, I don't the believe the resurrection happened and at that point I already feel like we might as well say that the historical Jesus could be entirely disconnected from the *real* one. I'm not sure what it means to say "Jesus lived" if we can't pin down any facts.
