- [[Blog]] [[Liberal]] [[Christianity]] [[Greenbelt]]
- I went to Greenbelt for a day on Friday. Greenbelt is a liberal Christian festival focusing on justice, music and the arts. It was fun, but also a culture shock, since when I was a Christian, I wouldn't have gone. I felt both scared and excited to do something slightly transgressive - *talk liberal to me, baby.*
- "Liberal Christians? So they believe in free speech?" No, I suggest you learn two key Christian tribal blocks. There are evangelical/conservative Christians who think that the Bible is true and so LGBT+ behaviour is bad, that men and women have different roles. Liberal/progressive Christians take more mainstream views on these topics and often focus on love and justice in the world today. *Note that liberal christians have woke/progressive views, rather than liberal ones. *
  These two blocks don't like each other. In some sense adherents each think the other has got Christianity tragically wrong. It’s like they watch the same film and each party thinks the other has completely misunderstood the central message. “Of course gay sex is sinful - the Bible says so! God hates it” vs “Of course LGBT+ people are accepted by God. Love and acceptance is His whole deal.” Honestly it might be easier if they just thought they worshipped a different God.
- So. Greenbelt.
- Greenbelt is a typical small UK festival with some social justice on the side. People camp and then there are several stages, lots of booths from different, mainly-christian charities and talks from politicians and activists. ~10,000 people go over the weekend and in the past they’ve had Bono and Russel Brand (I’m told).
- I found the experience kind of jarring. As a young adult, I think Greenbelt would have left me deeply uncomfortable. My faith wasn’t easy to maintain, knowing many people disagreed with me, taking odd positions in arguments and not having sex. But other people’s combativeness provided a kind of outside pressure that kept me stable. To find myself in a Christian environment that was politically left-wing, flirty and functioning might have caused a breakdown. *Perhaps I could be like this, maybe I would be happier? Am I allowed that?* I wish there had a been a space like this that had felt safe for me.

- There is a small, still-evangelical part of me that hates places like this and the people who go to them. He thinks that they ignore the Bible and take stances that are popular rather than true. I feel this annoyance pulsing through me at times, like an angry neighbour in the flat below. I do not hate him, in fact I love him, but I also feel sad that he’s so hurt and furious. It’s like being angry over the rules of Warhammer - it’s an interesting discussion but it doesn’t *matter*. Liberals do not deserve his spite.
- A woman said to me “It troubles me that the evangelical Churches are growing more. I don’t see God in them”. I found this strange, because evangelicals don’t see God in her church either. There is a sort of breakup in UK Anglicanism over trans and LGBT+ issues, and I guess each group of Christians thinks the other has gone completely off the rails. It’s kind of sad to me that she should be so un-self-aware here (not that evangelicals would be much better). Each group thinks they hold the sole understanding of what God wants. *Sigh.*
- I enjoyed the chilled vibe. Liberal Christians are relaxed and genuine. They really want to end poverty, to reduce racial inequity, to end LGBT+ suffering. And they aren’t as prickly or self-involved as some progressive spaces I’ve been in. And there is none of the self-flagellation of an evangelical conference, where the talks are deep and challenging. They’ll say hi, offer you a seat, talk about nothing. I’m sure many are personally generous. If this is your vibe, you’ll have a great time.
- I struggled to see the impact. If you are a regular Greenbelt attendee, please write to me. What has Greenbelt achieved? Grace Petrie sang a song with the words “If I spend my life on the losing side, they can lay me down knowing that I've tried," and while it was a great tune, I struggled to watch a 1000 middle class people mournfully singing it. If they spend their lives on the losing side I suggest it was because they didn’t give enough money to effective left-wing advocacy. This was a place oozing with middle-class wealth but also an anger at the current status quo. It made me want to shake people - *Are you aware that the top donor level for the Labour party is £5000? Do you know you can commission a think tank report for £20k? Stop crying into your oat milk latte and go win the next election.*
- I’m being unfair to liberal Christians. To any Greenbelt types reading this, I’d like to work together on ending global poverty. Let’s get back to 0.7% of GDP going on Aid. Let’s spend more on poverty in the UK. But I can’t deny it gets under my skin. It feels like you think you are powerless. You know that’s bollocks, right? You know you could actually change the UK if you wanted to. Sorry, I'll get out of your face.
- Gordon Brown is quite a good speaker. Not a lot of content but I was left feeling he was a deeply moral man and given what Blair and Cameron’s self-confidence achieved, perhaps I underrated his humility. It’s not easy to see the mistakes you choose not to make, perhaps he avoided some mistakes in his, I sense, fairly workaday premiership.
  Noone knows how to run events and Greenbelt don’t either. I have been spoiled by [EA Globals](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-global) with their ruthless focus on creating connection and agency in attendees. If I ran Greenbelt, I’d suggest that 80% of political talks need to be focused on connection - *how can people meet those they will work with in future? How can we optimise this festival for the creation of justice campaigns? *The people do not know what they need. I refuse to give talks that people could find on youtube.
- Find some millionaires. I know that this annoys people, but [earning to give](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give) is underrated. Most communities could do with a few multimillionaires to support their work. Greenbelt is no different. If they focused on empowering young people to become entrepreneurs they could massively increase the work they do. And yes they would have to wrestle with how they were part of a system they sought to change. And this would be a good thing.
- Progressives are pretty gloomy. It surprised me that the self-concept of these people was of defeat. They think they are losing on LGBT+ issues (I disagree), on the climate (I disagree) and politically in general (It’s been a bad few years, but it’s on the up). Again, this bothered me because they are obviously so wealthy, but also it just seems incorrect. And it’s a pretty dangerous cocktail to mix power and defeatism. It means people can never acknowledge their wins and so never discuss honestly with other groups. The UK is *much *more LGBT+ friendly than when I grew up. It is bad to act as if this isn’t the case. We aren’t where we need to be but let’s not pretend we haven’t moved.
- I don’t enjoy camping. Greenbelt was pretty fun, but I wouldn’t have wanted to stay overnight unless I’d found a local airBnB. I hate the burning sun in the mornings and the hot groggy stuffiness of tents. I hate not being able to sleep for the noise of everyone else. Cities are good for agglomeration effects but if I had the use of a teleporter I’d live on an island with good plumbing.
  What would a city-wide festival look like?  Could we make our cities more like this? What would it be like if there were things you could go to all the time and everyone was happy to smile and talk? In some sense that’s already what a city is - there are cinemas and bars. But I think that London could be friendlier. If we had more shared trust and narrative I think even a very multicultural city could have a lot of connection. I’d love to see that.
  I’ve changed a lot. I went to a conservative Christian wedding about 10 years ago and the talk was about the Nutcracker - how the female lead has to listen and follow her man in order to get what’s good out of life. A friend turned to me and said “this is mad”. I said “sure, but there is nothing that we can disagree with”. While it makes me smile to hear my polite disagreement, I do disagree with the talk now. Women can make their own decisions. And this friend reminding me of the story sitting in the middle of Greenbelt brought to mind how much I’d changed. I disavow most positions my faith caused me to take and I think many are actively harmful. Also there was an arrogance in my evangelicalism - *how strange that talk must have seemed to the very people it was trying to convince.*
- My theory on liberal vs conservative Christians. The conservative Christians I know had an experience of God or truth that led them to think “huh, this Bible has got some great stuff in it, I wonder what else it says” whereas I think that liberal Christians meet the community and think “I want to be with these people”. In some sense one is a top down approach whereas the other is bottom up. Sure, conservatives have some homophobic intuitions, but I don’t believe their anti-LGBT+ stances would survive without the Bible. Similarly, without the modern world, progressive Chrisitans would be beaten into submission by people pointing out the text of the Bible, as has been true throughout history. It’s strange that two groups can be so similar and so different. I guess I think they are travellling in opposite directions down a motorway, meeting at a service station - they are in a similar place sometimes, but for quite different reasons with very different practices.
- Liberal Christians are alright. I am prone to be judgmental to my ancient adversaries, but they get a lot correct. In my mind, liberal Christians are right about LGBT+ behaviour, right about abortion, right about the relations between men and women, right about acting against poverty. And they keep much of what is good about evangelicalism too - they still like forgiveness and personal kindness. I think as tribes go, you could do much, much worse. I think that there is less chance of them turning out spectacular successes than more ideological communities, but speaking as part of a community whose brightest boy recently defrauded $8Bn you might think that’s fair enough (though on balance, I don’t 😬). But it’s much better than many communities, which are either entirely without flavour or insane. And honestly I imagine a focus on Jesus and justice is probably a pretty good vaccine against becoming insane and bitching all day on twitter.
- Would I trade my previous evangelicalism for liberalism? To try and bite an interesting bullet, I don’t know that I could have been a liberal. I am an all or nothing kind of guy. And so I was all and now I am nothing. But I guess I would have preferred to learn what these liberals know - that you don’t have to argue every point and that things that feel good are generally good. But I also like what I know from my previous evangelicalism - that the right answer can be uncomfortable and you need to understand the whole of the argument. These days I try to have both.
- Don’t ask me about Greenbelt. Ultimately, I don't really know what any community believes, and they often don't fully know themselves. I don’t think you should trust my account of Greenbelt, because you weren’t an evangelical, you didn’t fear and long for this place and you aren’t proud of and disappointed by it. I can’t really say what Greenbelt is like - but if you like middle-class progressive Christianity, hearing about justice and music, it seems pretty good.
- And if you’re a Greenbelter, maybe we can work together some time. Cos justice isn’t about vibes, it’s about helping people in need, and I sense we can agree on that.
