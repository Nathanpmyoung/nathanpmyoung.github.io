- Both my grandmother and my great aunt passed away recently, which has called me to muse upon death.
- Death for me is about we're all dying from one moment to the next. This person I am in this exact moment is not... I don't believe in souls, therefore not deeply connected to a future person. We're not perfectly connected in some way. There is a dying that's happening constantly as we change, as we bequeath our atoms and our resources to a person who makes slightly different choices than the ones we would have. In some sense, literally when we wake up and go to sleep there's a real process of dying.
- I think philosophically speaking, the answer is it seems to be starting backwards but not necessarily forwards, much like cloning. If you clone, then both clones will think they are me, or waking up from cryo sleep or teleportation or any of these. It's really about where the consciousness ends up. Whatever it ends up, that thing will think it's me and be glad to exist. Will I continue to be conscious? That doesn't really have meaning because I will stop being conscious once I've gone to sleep or once I step into the teleportation booth. My consciousness is very shallow or fleeting. It was always going to end.
- I think this notion of identity becomes more difficult as one hangs around with elderly people because we can see that bequeathing forward process sort of going wrong. You can see someone you love turning into someone you don't like, not because of small acts of cruelty but just the slow accumulation of genes not strippe kind and easy going can become confused or angry or just slowly develop a sort of deadness behind their eyes.unjust. There's something really awful about seeing someone you love become someone you don't feel so strongly about. And in some sense people being asked to care for people with dementia seems like an exquisite torture. The next one is often about resources, about Robert Hansen's age of M.
