- Pirates 1 is very good. It has a clever interconnected plot, a serviceable love story and Jonny Depp is fantastic as Captain Jack Sparrow. The music is excellent.
- Pirates 2 is fine. Jack Sparrow is good, but overused. Davy Jones is fantastic, especially for 2006. The film is bloated and dumber than it attempts to be.
- What is actually going wrong here?
  - The filmmakers seem to think that the thing people liked about the first film was Jack, complex sword fights and the music and confusing plots.
  - I think this misses the story being good. In the first film, the story elements make sense and come to nice conclusions
- Attempted fix
  - The East India Trading Company already have the heart. That's where it is. They want the compass for their own reasons.
  - Ditch the cannibals plot. It accomplishes nothing.
  - Isla de Muerta hasn't sunk into the sea, Jack is currently spending the gold in it
  - Will still goes onto the flying dutchman to meet his father
  - Norrington is still a naval officer
  - Will gets the key back to Jack
  - Where is Elizabeth?
