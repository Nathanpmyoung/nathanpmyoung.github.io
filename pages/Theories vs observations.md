- I would like to see more delineation between theories and observations
  - Often I'll see a post like [] and I'll think "Is that something you've seen or is it a suggestion"
- Similar to my thoughts on [[Journalism]] where I think there is a difference between reporters and commentators.
- Theories:
  - Not necessarily true
  - Have sharp edges
- Observations:
  - Clear about what you've seen
- Studies
  - Take a theory and test it properly
