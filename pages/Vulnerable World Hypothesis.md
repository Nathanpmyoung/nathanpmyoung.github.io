- Bostrom discusses if a nuclear explosion could be made using glass metal and a battery.
	- An alternative approach would be to eliminate all glass, metal, or sources of electrical current (save perhaps in a few highly guarded military depots). Given the ubiquity of these materials, such an undertaking would be extremely daunting. Securing political support for such measures would be
	  no easier than shutting down physics education. However, after mushroom clouds had risen over a few cities, the political will to make the attempt could probably be mustered.
