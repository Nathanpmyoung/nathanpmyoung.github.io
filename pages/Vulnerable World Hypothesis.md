- Bostrom discusses if a nuclear explosion could be made using glass metal and a battery. Here is a short quote:
	- An alternative approach would be to eliminate all glass, metal, or sources of electrical current (save perhaps in a few highly guarded military depots). Given the ubiquity of these materials, such an undertaking would be extremely daunting. Securing political support for such measures would be
	  no easier than shutting down physics education. However, after mushroom clouds had risen over a few cities, the political will to make the attempt could probably be mustered.
- He is right that in principle, it is plausible that easy, massively destructive technology exists.
- I am not fully convinced by this:
	- It seems if it were that easy it would probably have happened by now
	- Very few people want to kill everyone, even if it is very easy, suicide bombers are pretty rare
	- The technologies could get replaced - eg glass with perspex
	- Humans are good at banning even very beneficial technologies [[Slowed technologies]]
