- Could be [[Blog]]
- I worked as a Civil Servant for 6 months
- They are hard working
- The systems are very hard to change. [[Dominic Cummings]] is right when he describes the difficulty of using [[Google Docs]]. I remember spending several hours taking a hundred page document, removing the tracked changes and then creating a new version with those tracked changes in red text. For clarity, I literally copied each change, removed it and then replaced it in another version, with the font set to red.
- I was not good at my job and but they wouldn't have fired me. I was trying to be good at it, but I just wasn't.
