- Nevertheless, in the realm of pension funds, to own is not to control.
  "Though vested participants [in a pension fund] have a recognized
  ownership interest in the assets held for their benefit, there is no legal right
  to control deriving from this reality."'17 As a result, some commentators
  maintain that, rather than deriving the benefits of ownership from their
  pension funds, the interests of many workers have in fact been undermined
  by them.' In particular, unions, establishing through collective bargaining
  approximately forty percent of all private sector plans, 9 have "looked with
  disgust at the investment of their pension assets in foreign and domestic
  nonunion competition in industry .... ,20 These funds, in their estimation,
  have been "used to finance the loss of their members' jobs and retirement
  income security.' [[Quote]]

- Unions seem basically a natural part of capitalism. If it's about negotiating whatever price you can and a company gets to share information with itself, then surely so do employees?
- Though it seems cartels and monopolies are more illegal for companies than unions.
- Like generally I think companies can charge whatever they can get away with for their products. Same seems true of labour, right?
- Like I can be frustrated, but I'm pro the system, so I should in general be pro its results.
- I'm less sure that strikers should be protected from being fired. Though it feels like unions should be able to build up big funds to insure against this.
