- Spreading ideas is a lot about being good at replies.
- Some of you reply to me, I replying to Matt Yglesias, Yglesias is replying to Biden. Each of us wants the person above them in the chain to take their ideas seriously and spread them.
- So this involves
	- [[Yes, And]]
	- Adding information
- Some things this is not
	- Being a yes man
	- Using people as means, not ends - I befriend and unbefriend people on whether i like them and try not to think too much about usefulness. I do a bit, sure, but I find that forcing a friendship as a means to get something rarely works and feels two faced. If you spot someone doing this, [[Red Flag]] !
