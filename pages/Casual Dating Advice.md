alias:: dating advice

- I do fine in dating. And often I see people asking for things I have - more connection to people they are attracted to.
- Much dating advice seems terrible to me. What follows is my thoughts
- Perhaps I do fine because I am popular in general
- Much advice I seem contradicts my experience. Here is advice I see
	- Become very stoic
	- Be hard to get
	- Don't be a feminist
- I am not saying this is good or bad advice. It just seems like noise to me
- Instead, things that have had success for me
- Try to leave people with a not bad experience. If you date women (or anyone with a body smaller than yours) chances are that their downside risk is higher than yours. Much of their time/focus may be about avoiding that. So a good start is to try and reduce it.
	- Learn to create space for someone to say no. Much is made of enthusiastic positive consent, but I finding space for expressions of non-consent is underrated. I want both types of feedback, both "gosh, Yes!" and "ehhh not into that right now thanks". Sometimes with partners I don't know I will explicitly practice asking and receiving "No". Can I touch your shoulder "No". And yes, this is a bit weird, but if I can't bear 5 minutes of awkwardness with someone, I don't want to have sex with them. What if they don't want something, but it's too awkward?
	- Consider bad patterns and ask your friends. Write a list of what someone would say are your worst ever behaviours. Then share it with some people you trust. Ask them how could you avoid having those happen again? It doesn't matter whether they are literally what happened. If someone is really upset then it maybe something to avoid, for your sake.
- Talk to your friends and ask what would make you a better partner.
- Read things by the kinds of people you are attracted to about what they are looking for (sadly little of this exists in my experience)
- Be easy to get. Yes! You've heard it said "be hard to get" but I say to you "be easy to get". I try to put out vibes that if you want to hang out with me for an evening, I'll give you my attention, have some fun chat and then, if you want, we'll have sex, focused on you. And for me, that works. It's not that unusual for women to ask me for hookups, to send me nudes or to express that they want to have sex with me. Now sure, maybe this is deeply alien to you (worth rememberin ght)
