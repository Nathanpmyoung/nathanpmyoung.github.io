- Let's look through this list - the first on [[Goodreads - Goodreads Delenda Est]] https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/1118.Best_Fantasy_of_the_90s
	- [[Harry Potter]] - not sexy
	- [[A Game of Thrones]] - pretty sexy, but pretty chaste by 90s standards
	- [[The Eye of the World]] - I thought this book was overrated, it is probably sexy
	- [[Northern Lights]] - not sexy
	- [[Assassin's Apprentice]] - Absolutely sexy. Also heartbreaking [[Robin Hobb]] what did your main characters do to you?
- I'm not sure if I've made my point or not, but I'm bored. If I were more thorough we could look at other genres and see if it was the same.
- Why is this the case? Theories
	- Fantasy audiences were mainly guys who largely thought this content was beneficial and the authors wanted to explore it.
	- There often seem to be elements of wish fulfilment
	- Community norms - if everyone else writes ludicrous sex scenes into their books, I guess you think it's normal and so do too
	- Some kind of backlash against norms in other areas of writing?
