Trigger Action Protocols.md

- Improving hard conversations
    - Trigger: My gut says "This conversation might end badly"
    - Action: Talk Claude through the convesation as balancedly as possible
    - Other notes:
        - Often I sort want to rush hard conversations so that I don't have to spend a lot of time in the scary place. But sometimes this makes them even worse.
        - I have had at least 2 hard converstions that have gone much better with claude giving tips first.
