- Blackmailing myself with nice things

- When I have a nice thing coming up, I tend to work less, so that in the time just before the thing I'll really have to do it.
- Theories as to why

  - Given that I actually want the thing, I am confident that I will get needed work done. This means I can work less in the meantime.

- Examples
  - Leaving work until just before dates
  - Staying up before a flightS
