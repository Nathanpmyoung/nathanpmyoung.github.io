- A pair of blogs on English politics and [[Christianity]]
- [[UK]]
- First blog
  - The English Conservative Evangelical Worldview
  - A study of one of the worldviews of my family and friends
  - Theory
    - The country is going to the dogs
  - Evidence
    - mental illness/anxiety,
    - no national identity
    - less focus on family
    - LGBT+
    - Low growth
  - Counter evidence
    - Britain is still a safe wealthy country
  - Theory
    - Nations that turn away from God suffer.
  - Evidence
    - Bible
    - Selective reading of history
  - Counter evidence
    - Perhaps an acknowledgement that God's plans are mysterious
  - If Christianity is better, why don't people believe it?
  - Theory
    - People don't want the hard medicine
  - Evidence
  - Counter evidence
    - Some notion that in some way non-Christians lives are harder
  - Some similarities to hard times weak mean analogy
  - Context
    - God loves us and has created a way for us ot live
    - Humanity is sinful
    - Jesus died to forgive sin
    - There are laws for a good nation
    - Not following them leads to the world we see
    - A christian remnant survives
  - Weaknesses of the argument
    - Circular reasoning on what is good - LGBT+ is bad because of the bible but this is evidence that Britian is doing badly because it has turned away
    - Little actual scholarship of what causes nations to succeed. Is the US very Christian, or China? They are doing well. Not clear there is an actual standard here.
    - Much of this isn't load bearing, seems like they would believe this even in a very successful non-Christain country
    - Doesn't deal with harms created
    - More general issues with Christianity
- Second blog
  - A comparison between evangelical Christianity and [choose a name for my thoughts]
  - To me it's about which story better explains the world I see
  - Evolution
    - Unlikely, clear steps
    - Genetic selection
    - Humans coordinating and competing
    - Complex social structures and technology
    - Requires trust in many steps and institutions
  - Christianity
    - God can't abide by sin
    - God creates humans
    - God give free will
    - Humans choose sin
    - Jesus died to forgive sin and bring humans back into relationship with God
    - Some accept
    - Some refuse and suffer eternal torment
    - Focuses on personal faith
  - Conflict
    - Prefer falsifiable things
      - when I check evolution I find it makes sense
      - When I check Christianity I find more confusion
      - Do you choose something falsifiablewith like a 0.00001% chance or something unfalsifiable with a only 1 huge question
    - We don't have good concepts for likelihood
      - Evolution feels unlikely because our brains perform well at imagining people, but under a scientific worldview evolution is simpler than imagining some all powerful conscious deity
    - God's justice doesn't make sense to me
      - God builds pit with a weak edge and says don't stand near it
      - I do
      - I fall in
      - Jesus comes across the sea and saves me
      - I am expected to be grateful
      - There are two way to look at this story, either it's obvious I should be grateful or it's cosmic guilt tripping on the part of God.
      - And this is before we get into adam and eve (why am I punished for their sin?) or creation (I didn't decide to be born?)
    - I am not sure what Chrisitanity explains that evolution doesn't
      - Evolution explains why we see many of the specific thigns we do - differences between creatures
      - What does chrisitanity explain above this?
      - Already have explanations for selfishness and hope, and I don't find the gospels particularly hard to explain
    - If I imagine that this weren't the case, that the bible formed a single self-consistent moral account, would i be more intrested? A bit.
      - In some sense I am oopen to the idea that a god is real and one day I will face judgement, but I can't say I respect the guy.
      - If the moral calculus made sense then maybe I would feel more like taking a punt on christianity?
      - But I think I'd still say, what needs to be explained here?
