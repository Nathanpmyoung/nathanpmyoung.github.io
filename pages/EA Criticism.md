- I find much [[EA]] criticism to be bunk, but some of it is good. Here I will reference criticisms I think have merit:
- MOAR CRITICISM! - EAs want ever more criticism
	- The vibe of [[EA]] is that criticism is underrated and so we should have more of it regardless of quality. A sort of general subsidy for criticism. For a long time I felt this way myself. That I should praise anyone criticising EA (or to a lesser extent me) because I wanted people to feel free to criticise.
	- This ends badly. In hindsight, obviously.
	- This incentivises cheap criticism. The praise you get is the same regardless of the quality of the criticism and so for any expensive criticism the subsidy is small. But for bad criticism the praise subsidy covers almost the whole cost, so it's much more likely to be the difference between it being created and not.
	- Many other communities actively disincentivise cheap criticism, by pushing back strongly on any and all criticism. I guess this has the opposite effect, muting easy criticism, but leaving costlier criticism similar.

	- *Feelings were the great loophole for Mill. His fundamental metric of happiness rested on the foundation of feelings, and it turned out that his feelings were—without his fully realizing it—under his control. In order to justify his relationship with Harriet, he needed his passion for her to overwhelm anyone else’s unhappiness in the utilitarian calculation, and so his feelings grew and grew until the equation balanced.* - https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2017/05/romance-socialism-j-s-mill/
