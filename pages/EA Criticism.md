- *The vibe of [[EA]] is that criticism is underrated and so we should have more of it even if it is bad. I think this is wrong. Good criticism is underrated. Bad criticism is overrated. We should encourage good criticism. We (myself very much included) have a habit of encouraging bad criticism so we can feel epistemically pure. This is an error see - [[Wanting to Think Well Isn't The Same as Doing It]]*
