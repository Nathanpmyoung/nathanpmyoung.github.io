-The platform has significant unrealized potential in facilitating Bayesian analysis and debate.

- Either
  - The platform could be a simple reference document
  - The platform could be an interactive analytical tool
  - The platform could be a way to search the debates
- Currently it does none of these and is frustrating for this reason
- I expect any of the following
  - to be able to search the debates
  - to be able to input my own probability estimates to the current bayesian framework
- Failing this, I would prefer to just have a reference document which doesn't promise these
