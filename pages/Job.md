- I really like the book of Job. It is very hard to guess what's going to happen next and gives a compelling picture of a strongman deity, such as [[Yahweh]].
- The narrative beats
	- Satan appears in Heaven and says "Your servant job is only devout because you bless him. If he weren't you'd not be"
	- God says "Okay sure, let's test it"
	- He kills Job's kids
	- Job is still devout
	- Satan says "Oh you took away his stuff but he's still healthy"
	- God gives Job sores and so he sits in the dust and everyone deserts him. He scratches himself with a shard of pottery
	- His friends surround him for 35 chapters and tell him to give it up and repent. He's clearly upset God and so been cursed, so he should repent and die
	- Job says no, he hasn't sinned, so he has nothing to repent for
	- God appears, and in a 200 bar segment most rappers can only dream of slams everyone. He slams job, for thinking he understand the world, he slams Jobs friends for calling Him unjust. He is God, with a capital G, he made the world he understands it all, he feels no obligation to explain himself
	- God tells Job that his freinds have sinned and Job should make a sacrifice for them so that God doens't punish them
	- God disappears
	- God gives Job more kids (3 daughters who he names after cosmetics) and the story ends
- This is *wild*. I wouldn't recommend reading Job, it's very long, but maybe I'll write a shorter version some time. But what bombast?!
- Let's go over the above.
	- Satan appears in heaven. I didn't even know Satan could do this? Isn't the holy of holies too much for him?
	- Satan challenges God to a wager. Why on earth and on heaven does God take this wager. What does He have to gain? Maybe his glory and a useful story? *Outside of the narrative I think it's just an older and rougher version of Yahweh - he's not the all-powerful god of the New Testament but a tribal god and tribal gods occasionally want to one-up their adversaries.*
	- God says to test it - there is admirable falsificationalism from everyone involved. I wish more people today took the Satan Yahweh approach
