- [[Favourite]] [[C. S. Lewis]] [[book]]
- I like this book.
- It's a depiction of a denizen of hell being given a tour of heaven (there is literally a bus).
- C. S. Lewis is a better writer than most of the Biblical authors. He spots issues and fixes them. When Lewis describes heaven he claims not to be trying to give an actual description. But his description is much less flawed than standard protestant theology.
  - There is redemption after death - those who are destined for heaven were always destined, whether the changed happened before or after life.
  - There is a reason why angels etc don't visit hell - it's too small for them. Hell is so weak and insubsantial that they can't fit there.
    - This isn't really a good answer, but it's better than the Bible's and Lewis at least acknoweledges the problem
- ## The great divorce has some great imagery
  - [[Quote]] [[C. S. Lewis]] But very far away I could see what might be either a great bank of cloud or a range of mountains. Sometimes I could make out in it steep forests, farwithdrawing valleys, and even mountain cities perched on inaccessible summits. At other times it became indistinct. The height was so enormous that my waking sight could not have taken in such an object at all. Light brooded on the top of it: slanting down thence it made long shadows behind every tree on the plain. There was no change and no progression as the hours passed. The promise or the threat of sunriseÂ rested immovably up there.
