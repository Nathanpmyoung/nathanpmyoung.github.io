- [[Quote]] [[C. S. Lewis]] But very far away I could see what might be either a great bank of cloud or a range of mountains. Sometimes I could make out in it steep forests, farwithdrawing valleys, and even mountain cities perched on inaccessible summits. At other times it became indistinct. The height was so enormous that my waking sight could not have taken in such an object at all. Light brooded on the top of it: slanting down thence it made long shadows behind every tree on the plain. There was no change and no progression as the hours passed. The promise or the threat of sunriseÂ rested immovably up there.
