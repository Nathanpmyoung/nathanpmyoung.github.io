- Two children are fighting. Who is at fault? Biff or Chip? Or maybe both. Perhaps it is 6 of 1 and half a dozen of the other.
- Or maybe, sharing blame isn't really the thing to do here. Maybe Chip often annoys biff, who is bigger, until Biff hits him. But biff is bigger and older. Perhaps, being children it isn't Biff's job to police his own boundaries, though nor is it kippers. Perhaps there is a problem with the system.
- When I was a Christian, it was typical to look for a single person to blame when something went wrong. Their theology was that God primarily relates to individuals, so if something has gone wrong, then it is probably an individual who has done it, an individual who must repent.
- But sometimes this led to issues where it wasn't easy to decide who was at fault. If an individual had a bad experience and left the church it seemed either to be the fault of the person leaving or whoever had recently upset them. This ignores the possibility that there was some broader problem, something that didn't work for them that could be fixed.
- [research the following anecdote
- The [[German auto-emissions scandal]] has been blamed on one engineer, [name]. This is very likely bunk - one person didn't come up with or benefit from this scandal - it was many people, engineers, testers and management, who all conspired together for the sake of financial and social gain. They wanted to keep their jobs or move up in the company and that required cars sales, which required a good environmental record which required.. lying.
- In both cases, it is easier to blame a single individual (or a small group) rather than try and understand what caused the issue to happen. And as a result, it seems to me that many such situations are likely to happen again.
- In the "sin" framing, because sin is about individual debt towards God, there isn't space for "systemic sin" where no-one individual is to blame, but somehow the setup of the system itself is against God. I imagine some, especially liberal Christian traditions have a concept here.
- In the systems theory setting, it is easier to scapegoat an individual node than it is to for the system to engage in a process of self-evaluation and change. If it does, perhaps the whole system will stop running. It seems plausible that systems scapegoat, because those systems that didn't died out. Selection pressures might push for systems that take less account of their behaviour

- it was blamed on one engineer as if one engineer was most of the reason it happened. This served to scapegoat the system. [[Clem]] pointed out that in some sense systems are selected for this. Systems that don't survive.. don't survive. We should be unsurprised that systems that exist have features to survive scandals.
