- Many things that were previously binaries are now considered spectrums
  - Gender
  - Sexuality
  - Mental illness
  - Agression

- But thinking about spectra is expensive. I binary can take one of two values. A spectra might require 10 or 20 bits of information, and my sense is the mind is worse at encoding this than computers are. Often spectra feel fare more difficult to think about, with every new entry often requiring a specific memory. It's much less like categorising.
