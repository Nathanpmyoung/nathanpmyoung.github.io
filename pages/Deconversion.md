- I used to be an [[Evangelical Christian]]. I thought [[God]] was real and the highest [[Good]].
- In 2019 I spent 5 weeks researching doubts I had
- By the end I no longer considered myself a Christian
- Here are some notes from that.
- Christians sometimes talk about a 4 step process
	- Conversion
	- Stabilty
	- Deconstruction
	- Recreation
- I guess I see this pattern in my own life. I became a Christian, I grew for 10-15 years, the frame I had built didn't make sense and so it tumbled to pieces. I can see the attraction of rebuilding what I had - to some extent I am, but I don't see why I should want [[Jesus]] at the center of it. I don't know what assuming him adds.

- # The Process
- ## What is it?
- I will take 5 weeks off work exploring the points and counterpoints to if the God of the Bible is real. I will search within each point to see if it stands up to criticism. Points (or counterpoints) which don’t stand up to criticism will be ignored. I will count the number of (surviving) points, and the number of counterpoints and which ever side has more will convince me, either of God’s existence or that I do not know. Note I am not seeking to see if He doesn’t exist, there is no way I could know that. Perhaps if there are similar numbers and lots for each, I will add extra time to the process, I don’t know. Note that if there are none for each, I guess I wouldn’t believe in God, since there is no reason to, whereas if there lots for each it would be much harder. At the end I will either continue as a Christian and work out what I want to do with the rest of my life or I will stop considering myself one, I will stop going to church, praying, considering God’s law the highest duty and doing all that I do and will likewise work out what I want to do with the rest of my life.
- Genuinely, if you think this is a bad process, how would you improve it and how would the new process be falsifiable
- ## Frequently Asked Questions
- ### Why take 5 weeks
	- This is largely arbitrary though I will be spending perhaps 22.5 hours a week thinking about this consistently. I can’t reasonably take much more time off work than this (even the current period may be stretching it). So in total I’ll have spent at least 110 hours thinkin on this in depth. If I were to spend evenings of normal life I guess this amount of thinking would be fractured and take about (2hours/day, 2 days/week,) over a year during which I would be unsure about whether I believed the core aspect of my life. Compressing this seems wise because it’s really painful.
	- Likewise other than in terms of Christianity’s somewhat final tone on apostasy ([Hebrews 6:4-6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+6%3A4-6&version=ESV)) this need not be my final decision. I can change my mind in the future, but I do not want to live this way for years if I do not think it is true.
- ### Surely you are just choosing what you want?
- Previously I have come to this crisis (“Is God real?”) and I would say I researched poorly. I remember thinking for a while and writing down the pros and cons. There were a lot more pros so I remember thinking “it need not be a hard decision, many things that are true aren’t” and I felt justified in believing in God. At that time I had read very few serious critiques of my position, nor did I debate with any serious agnostics/athiests. I would say now that I made that choice in a poor way, largely subjectively, by using a process which would only get me what I wanted.
- Can the same criticism be leveled at the current process?
- The attempt here is to create a process which is objective and stands aside from what I want to be the case. Notably that it is a process which could actually make me leave Christianity. I didn’t intend to leave, but I though if I was to honestly engage my process would have to be able to make me do so. My world view had to be falsifiable. Perhaps this process is flawed, I’m interested to know your thoughts, but any other process must in my opinion be better. (this may be a [best map fallacy](https://twitter.com/NathanpmYoung/status/1089920106782748672), but I think modern evangelical Christianity is too therefore, by that thought I should become a Catholic)
- As to what I want, I have moved around. To begin with I wanted to be a Christian. Largely now I don’t. Often towards the end of long conversations with Christians I do want to be one. It is perhaps at some of those points I think, if this weren’t a rigorous process with safeguards that I think I could stop thinking about this and convince myself I had.
- ### You seem quite down, can you trust yourself to make life-changing decisions?
- This is the most fundamental thing in my life, I cannot imagine that this process would ever be easy or pain free. This *is* hard, I *am *stressed, it does make me emotional. But that is hardly surprising and I don’t think I would think better about it over a longer period of time, I think I would just be more uncomfortable. In fact, as I contemplate extending the process I wonder whether I would just stay a Christian because it was easier and less painful, rendering the process just as unfalsifiable as I had previously feared. There has to be a chance I can leave so that my staying means anything.
- ### This all sounds very rational
- This requires a longer answer.
- ### This all sounds very emotional
- What can I say, I’m an emotional guy (#Joke). But seriously, I am emotional and at times insecure and what issue could I be more emotional about than this. There is an emotional side to all this, but I don't want to let that make the decision for me.
- I am happy to talk about the emotional issues, they are important, but they will not make me stay a Christian. Likewise, I think I have fairly good reasons for much of my anger towards my current situation and Christianity in general, if it isn’t true.
- ### You’re being an ass
- Sometimes, however:
	- I’m sorry for my rudeness and difficulty
	- This is really hard for me, I’m lonely, scared, hurt and constantly questioning all I have ever believed (please don’t think this makes the process bad unless you can suggest a better one). I realise that for some Christians I talk to, this is hard for them, both on interpersonal grounds but also ideological ones. Though let’s note that as hard as it is, I am having 10 - 20 interactions like this compared to their one.
	- People often want to talk about “how we got here” as opposed to genuinely dealing with the arguments at hand. That frustrates me. I am much happier to deal witth the emotional arguments once someone has shown a genuine issue in the more important intellectual side to all this.
	- Sometimes questioning any aspect of faith is considered being an ass, I’m not willing to stop questioning
	- Some positions are bad or are unlikely (in my opinion) to be genuinely held, I am tired of having to argue that slavery and child mortality are bad. I am tired of bizarre positions that people don't’ actually believe but suggest to argue against my positions. At these times, I might suggest an “arrogant” dismissal is the correct answer. If you think the Nazi’s werent’ bad, what can we honestly discuss?
	- Having people realise that you don’t believe the same things as them is awful, particularly having to watch them slowly realise. Sometimes it’s easier to be difficult and upset them rather so they dislike you rather than pitying and losing respect for you. This is a bad reason but hopefully it might explains something.
	- I am scared about my future, of losing all I hold dear. This is NOT a good argument for staying, but it doesn’t make it not scary to lose.
