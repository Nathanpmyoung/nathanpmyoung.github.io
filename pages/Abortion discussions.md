- A set of [[Discussion]]s about abortion
- [[Charlie Kirk]] discusses with 20 "woke" students about whether abortion should be punished like murder. This is a synthesis of the parts of the discussion I found most interesting.
	- Kirk: Let's start with definitions.
	- Student: Sure
	- Kirk: A foetus is a human life.
	- Student: Sure [or]
		- Student: Sure past a certain point.
		- Kirk: What point?
		- Student: 16 - 20 weeks
		- Kirk: Why not earlier?
	- Kirk: Murder should be punished.
	- Student: Sure
	- Kirk: Killing a human life is mudrer.
	- [If the student says yes here the discussion is basically done]
	- Student: Uh, no. I can think of several times that killing a person isn't murder, eg home defence.
