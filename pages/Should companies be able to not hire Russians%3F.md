- [[Discussion]] between Nathan and Bronson (who works in a nation next to Russia)
	- Bronson: My company just hired a Russian, we are all very upset
	- Nathan: In general, I think companies should not discriminate on the basis of nationality
	- Bronson: And what if none of us will work if we have a Russian working here?
	- Nathan: Is this a Russian who believes that Russia should have attacked Ukraine?
	- Bronson: It's a Russian. They are all like that that. Should I invest 10 hours figuring out if they are a rare good Russian?
	- Nathan: I still think that companies should hire without thought to race, religion, sexuality, nationality.
	- Bronson: Russians are different though. They enter countries and eventually overthrow them. To avoid this we need to cut out the rot early. This guy was already being thrown out because of sanctions, so I don't know why we helped him by hiring him remotely.
	- Nathan: Hmmm, I guess I have more sympathy, given this is what Russia did in Ukraine. Seems kind of a blunt tool to judge whether or not to hire someone
	- Bronson: It's what we have though. I don't want us to hire Russians.
	- Nathan: Hmmm, I guess I would favour companies being able to have more of their own norms, whether that be more progressive or more ladsy. I doubt I would run a company like this but I guess they should exist.
	- Bronson: And what would you do if we wouldn't work?
	- Nathan: I guess I wouldn't hire people who would withdraw their labour if we hired any extra person. I think people of any political beliefs should be able to work, as long as they do a good job and are polite.
	- Bronson: You don't know what they world is like
