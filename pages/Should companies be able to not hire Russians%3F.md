- [[Discussion]] between Nathan and Bronson
	- Bronson: My company just hired a Russian, we are all very upset
	- Nathan: In general, I think companies should not discriminate on the basis of nationality
	- Bronson: And what if none of us will work if we have a Russian working here?
	- Nathan: Is this a Russian who believes that Russia should have attacked Ukraine?
	- Bronson: It's a Russian. They are all like that that. Should I invest 10 hours figuring out if they are a rare good Russian?
	- Nathan: I still think that companies should hire without thought to race, religion, sexuality, nationality.
	- Bronson: Russians are different though.
