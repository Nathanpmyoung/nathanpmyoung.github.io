I went to Paris last week with my main partner, Katia. I apologize to anyone finding out about my polyamorous relationships through this note. While Katia is my most serious partner, she's not my only one. If we haven't discussed this yet it's because I didn't think it would go well, and I don’t think we should.

Katia often travels to conferences as part of her work as an AI forecaster, and I happily accompany her as a tall man.

Paris is excellent—probably at the top of my list for cities to live in. If my friends lived there, I'd love it. The housing is dense and visually coherent. The food is lovely, and the city is beautiful, maybe even more so London. At night, the light has a warm yellow hue, making it a pleasure to walk around.

I do find the French somewhat rude. Whenever I try to speak, often reply in English. My French is decent; I can hold conversation but feels discouraging when they switch to.

Also, I wouldn’t be surprised if France has more severe immigration issues than the UK I noticed many people selling goods outside the Eiffel Tower, which seemed unregulated and a bit shady, especially when armored police came by. It felt unsettling, and the area under the Eiffel Tower is blocked off, probably for security reasons, which is disappointing. I remember being able to walk under it as a child and gaze up in wonder.

Regarding travel, the Eurostar can be stressful. Traveling between similar economies like the UK and France should be easier, I don't see why full security is necessary for trains.

traveled via Lebanon, and there were some hairy moments. I was concerned about safety there, and the airport transfer process was confusing. Fortunately, everything worked out.

I think the core takeaway from discussing Dubai is how they transformed a flat seashore into a city with impressive buildings. My dad grew up around the Middle East and visited Dubai when there were no buildings on those beaches. It's incredible what they've accomplished, especially in the last30 years.

That said, what's Dubai actually like? Everything is very big, and it has a grand feel, but it doesn't seem to have much depth beneath that. It’t feel like a living city like London or Paris, which have been around for hundreds, if thousands, of, or like San Francisco with its entrepreneurial energy. Instead, it feels somewhat detached from everyday life.

There are huge buildings and attractions including a water, but that doesn't necessarily make it a destination want to visit. Many workers there seem content, but I sensed that the narrative around labor conditions exaggerated. It didn't feel particularly inexpensive I had to shop around to avoid overpaying for everything. All attractions have fees, which is fine, but I also to choose not to pay things. Someone else paid for my trip, and while I had fun, I don't think I would have justified the expense had been paying out pocket.

If you’re an urban planner, it might be worth a. I found it a bit like a sanitized Disneyland. Disneyland has its charm, especially for children, but I only went as an adult It's well-designed for people, something I sometimes feel London isn't.
