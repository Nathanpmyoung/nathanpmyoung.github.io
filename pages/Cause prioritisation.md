- [[Open Philanthropy]]'s [[Worldview Diversification]] is currently broken. As [[Richard Y Chappell]] points out. The [worldviews aren't actually worldviews](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dmEwQZSbPsYhFay2G/ea-worldviews-need-rethinking). In my view, they are [[Cause areas]], baking in something which shouldn't be baked in. [[EA]] should be [[Cause neutral]], but hard-coded cause areas aren't.
	- [[X-risk]] reduction on the margin seems more effective than [[Animal Welfare]] and [[Global Health]] by their own terms. If OpenPhil's categories are "reduce suffering to humans" "reduce suffering to animals" "reduce suffering to future people" all three should mainly be x-risk reduction, epistemics and community building.
