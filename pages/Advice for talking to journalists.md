- I have talked to 3-5 journalists about effective altruism, manifold.love and other stuff. Here are some thoughts and tips.
- Some journalists don't abide by some privacy norms. Are you in a group chat with a journalist? If so, would they use information that you think is private to write articles? Some would! #NotAllJournalists, yes, but it's my sense that a large chunk think "if I have heard it, I can write about it". And if I ask about this, they may act like I am the one who is asking for something weird. If I am in group chats with journalists I sometimes ask "we are off the record here, right?"
- So can I trust *this* journalist? Journalists vary a lot. Some will write accurate pieces and treat their sources well, others won't. When I talk to a journalist, I consider it a multiplier on what I say. If I am wrong, or they use my quotes to make an inaccurate point, I should feel bad.
- So when a journalist asks to speak to me:
	- I may read some of their previous articles in my area of expertise. Are they accurate? *See below*
	- Do friends think this person is trustworthy?
	- Would anyone be upset if this person broke trust or misquoted me? At least in the case of the New Yorker and the Financial Times, I have heard that there would be a lot of internal blowback if I was mistreated.
- How does, "on the record" work? Different journalists have different norms. But there is one thing that's most important. You both have to agree. It is not enough to say "we're off the record". If the journalist doesn't agree, then you aren't actually. And as above, you have to trust that there will be consequences for them if they break that trust. Before I talk I ensure we both understand the same thing about how this might be shared.
- So how does "on the record" work though?
	- explain different states
- Talking tight vs talking loose
- Am I confident I can do this? If not, don't
- Accuracy vs precision
- So why talk to journalists at all?
