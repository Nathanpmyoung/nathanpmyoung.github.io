- By some reasonable metric Robin is the most productive academic alive. I'm not saying he is, but if [[God]] appeared to me and told me he was I'd be suprised (there are a lot of academics) but I wouldn't be shocked as to the mechanism. I'd be like "yeah I can guess that someone who produced this much output and this many interesting ideas would in fact be the most productive person alive"
- In particular, I think (weakly confident) it he has come up with
	- [[Em]]s
	- [[The Great Filter]]
	- [[Grabby Aliens]]
	- [[Prediction Markets]]
- I spent a bit of time thinking about how Robin is so productive and I had a few calls with him my senses that there are two main things
- firstly Robin really believes in understanding things from top to bottom irregularly recommends Reading basic texts Reading textbooks first and trying to gain a nuts and bolts High school level understanding of a new topic rather than Reading vague accounts or high-level account you don't really understand.
- Secondly when Robin sees a problem he doesn't think oh bad problem he thinks how do we solve this a problem to him is a go faster sign not a slow down sign and he really is spectacular at this. Having seen him work he is extremely generative he comes up with all sorts of of the wall solutions. You're looking at an enemy in front of you and you're thinking about how to fight them in hand-to-hand combat and Robin is thinking about fleeing he's thinking about principal positions he's thinking about digging beneath them about building seed weaponry he's thinking about what you can negotiate with them that they might want to buy he's thinking about who you know the enemy ranks he's he's thinking about all these different problems and the solutions come up with just often wild and bad but sometimes really good and do you know once you put some kind of a filter onto robin in I think Robbins best ideas just way better than then the most peoples best ideas and he comes up with them more often
- how do I try and well I am trying to read more basic sources trying things trying to explain more things from to end. And also I am trying to have a different frame of mind when I come towards a problem on my mind that says okay how do we solve it is the problem can we figure our way round how can I generate a number of possible options.
