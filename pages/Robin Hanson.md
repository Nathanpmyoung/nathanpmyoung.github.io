- By some reasonable metric Robin is the most productive academic alive. I'm not saying he is, but if [[God]] appeared to me and told me he was I'd be suprised (there are a lot of academics) but I wouldn't be shocked as to the mechanism. I'd be like "yeah I can guess that someone who produced this much output and this many interesting ideas would in fact be the most productive person alive"

	- [[Em]]s
	- [[The Great Filter]]
	- [[Grabby Aliens]]
	- [[Prediction Markets]]
