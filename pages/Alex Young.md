- Here is an example of Alex's humour
	- *Discussing the film, Alien*
	- Me: It's surprising how little time the Alien is in it
	- Dad, not deliberately: I think it's just called Alien
	- I roll my eyes, conversation moves on.
	- Me later, Sure, but the Alien is visible for very few scenes
	- Alex, deliberately: It's just called Alien, no "the"
