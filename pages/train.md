	- When I was young, we lived in the real and so when we wanted to travel about, it wasn't just changing servers. It was lugging your brain wherever you wanted to go. Cars, trains, planes, boats.
	  
	  Yes I know you've been on these but you haven't *been* on one until you are bored out of your mind and the for another three hours. In your games, the most you sit is 5 minutes for some atmosphere between scenes. When I was growing up life wasn't as much meat as it is now - there was a lot of waiting.
	  
	  My sense is that my parents and grandparents had even more. By comparison I had TV and audiobooks and the internet. When my parents drove they would usually listen to music or take word puzzles (crosswords) from the daily paper.
	  
	  I don't think the modern day is bad, per se, but I think it's genuinely hard to imagine the boredom of it all. No slow cycles, no porting, no switching off. If you could sleep great, but I mostly couldn't.
