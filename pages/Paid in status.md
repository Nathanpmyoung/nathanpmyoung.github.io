  I am a moderator on Manifold.Markets. But I am not good at it.
  
  Manifold is a platform for running small betting markets. And by many metrics I am a poor moderator. I make a lot of markets often with unclear resolution criteria. I am literally the reason that moderators tag got changed from "trustworthy-ish" to "moderator". My markets are not even "trustworthy-ish". For a long time I had low rating.
  
  And I take criticism for this. People give me those low ratings, often with bad reviews. They make snarky comments on my markets.
  
  For a while it felt unfair. I am an unpaid moderator. Why should I take criticism for doing a job which takes up a reasonable amount of time (less these days) and for which I am not remunerated.
  
  But then I realised I am paid in status. I can resolve markets, I have a tag next to my name, I get to freely attend some manifold events.
  
  The issue here is that I didn't become a moderator to get status or even to moderate - I wanted to be able to make changes to the manifold frontpage. And this is a moderator power. And so the 'high status' part of the role is kind of bittersweet. I get benefits I don't want and take flack that feels unfair.
  
  Spotting it here has allowed me to see it in other places. When people are getting paid in status, even if they don't want to be.
  
  Here are some ways that people can get paid in status without wanting to/realising it and bad outcomes that can result:
  
  Abe wants some organisations to do something and none exist so he founds them. A group of people spring up around these organisations and look to Abe for advice. When Abe says stupid things they get annoyed at him. When there are crises, Abe is considered the person who ought to speak. Abe didn't ask for this to happen and is frustrated that it does. He just wanted some organisations to exist.
  
  Bernie is willing to say things that noone else is. Often in dramatic situations he will ask hard but pertinent questions. People assume he finds this gratifying, and while he does a bit, it is also scary and frustrating - but the questions need to be asked. As a result he receives hate mail and the perception that he desires attention. He would quite happily never ask a hard question again, as long as someone else did.
  
  Cathy makes good content on youtube. As a result she receives lots of romantic attention. When she turns it down people say she is a prude or a tease. She didn't ask to be considered attractive and feels like if she were a man, people would consider her work alone.
  
  Darren is very well dressed. People mock him for trying too hard or assume he has a high opinion of himself. He has a certain aesthetic sense and he is trying to expresse it. He didn't ask for all this attention, this style of dress used to be unfashionable and he dressed like it then too.
  
  Shiani is the UK prime minister. She earns about $160k a year and works all the time. She has significant amounts of power. Her life is pretty expensive. She has to book leisure trips last minute, make decisions based on security and her family face huge amounts of scrutiny. If she complains about any of this everyone points out how powerful and high status she is. While this is nice, it doesn't ease the stress on her husband. She wishes they could hire a nanny.
  
  Here are some cases that aren't part of this:
  
  Fred is a professional athlete. He wanted to be a star since he was a child and now he is. Recently he found this a bit annoying and was able to pay to live somewhere more private.
  
  Grace is an influencer who carefully cultivates her image and following. She sells ads and gets paid for it. While this isn't always ideal. It was roughly what she expected from her career.
  
  Harry is a politician who ran for office seeking power and influence. The status that comes with it is a slight benefit to him - he likes public speaking and meeting people, the romantic attention is not bad thing either.
  
  Let's recap then.
  
  Status is part of the remuneration package for many things we do. Some people want it, some don't. If one didn't seek it, one might feel underpaid or under appreciated. If one doesn't want it, it might almost feel like a cost.
  
  Certain high status roles may therefore select against people who don't want to do it for the status. I have heard people in the effective altruism space talk of the costs of running organisations in terms of scrutiny. This seems like a much lower cost to me.
  
  Likewise politicians are often far better communicators than regular people. Bill Clinton is has an aura of charisma. My friend still talks about that time he hear Tony Blair speak. And perhaps this is because skills are correlated and so
