[[AI]]

One issue I have with AI disempowerment is that that the word sounds a lot worse than it maybe is.

After WWII the UK got disempowered relative to the US, by engaging in largely mutually beneficial deals. Since then the UK is much wealthier. Is this some disaster?

Should the UK have hamstrung the US so that it couldn't become the world power? I suggest no.

Feels like [[Robin Hanson]] would argue this about mutually beneficial trades which lead to AI being the top power.

Then I feel like [[Katja Grace]] would point out that the top power could have been Russia which would have been very bad and that it does really depend who you are disempowered in relation to.

Katja actually argued that disempowerment is absolute, not relative. ie that the UK wasn't disempowered according to her difinition. But then I think it's less likely that it would be in general.
