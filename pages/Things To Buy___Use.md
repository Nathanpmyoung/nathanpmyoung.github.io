- Confident
	- You can probably earn more money than you currently do by asking your cleverest friends and doing what they say
		- When did you last negotiate a salary increase
		- Have you looked around at other salaries at other companies?
		- Most of my friends who think they couldn't get jobs at other companies are.. wrong. They have skills that would fetch a much higher price.
	- Always think about the price you'll offer before you're asked, never give a price without thinking about it
		- Be prepared!
			- "What salary are you thinking about?"
			- "What are you thinking of offering me?"
			- It can feel "mean" to answer questions like this, but it's exactly what they are doing. Why should you give away your information first?
		- They negotiate all the time, you do it once a year. You're at a disadvantage here.
