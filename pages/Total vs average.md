- In many situations there are tradeoffs between maximising the total of something and the average of it.
- Literal cases:
	- Choosing a restaurant. Do you want to have a lot of food, or maybe less, very good food in a more aesthetic location? For the price of *lot* of McDonalds, I can get a small portion at a very fancy restaurant.
	- Total vs average utilitarianism. Should we maximise utility, perhaps tiling the universe with rats on heroin, or should we aim for very high experiences for very few beings?
	- Immigration. My loose understanding is that immigration is good for the economy in a total sense, but perhaps destabilises countries a bit if it is different enough from the current population. In this sense you have a total view (espoused by [[Bryan Caplan]]) vs an average view (espoused by, say, [[Garrett Jones]]). Jones advocates for immigration only that increases the average of the country receiving the immigrants.
	- Future people and dignity. Should we push for the best future by our own lights (total) or some broader notion of dignity, which respects individual cultures even if we think they use their resources badly (average). As [[Carlsmith]] alludes, if 99% of the universe were friendly, liberal, stamp collectors, that might be very bad.
	- Risk. The risk neutrality vs aversion problem is one of total vs average also. Do you want to maximise total wealth across all possible worlds, weighted by  probability (think [[SBF]] in his own conception) or do you want to maximise some notion of the average, ie that in most worlds you don't go broke. To me this feels like it's an average with a square term, but someone cleverer than me can correct it.
	- Company strategy. Should a company hire many staff (total) even if the average productivity falls? Or should they stay small and lean (average)? Likewise should they have a small number of spectacular products or use their brand to get into every niche they can?
- Analagous cases:
	- Moral circles. Focus on a small group of close friends vs all consciousness.
