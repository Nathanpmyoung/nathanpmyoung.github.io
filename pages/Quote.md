- [[The Bible]] [[Job]] - *I have changed the translation for poetic license*
	- Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind:
	- “Who is this that darkens my counsel
	    with words without knowledge?
	  Brace yourself like a man;
	    I will question you,
	    and you shall answer me.
	- “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
	    Tell me, if you understand.
	  Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!
	    Who stretched a measuring line across it?
	  On what were its footings set,
	    or who laid its cornerstone—
	  while the morning stars sang together
	    and all the angels shouted for joy?

	- Despite my mistake, I am happy to say that my readership has so far been amazingly good about *not* using my rhetoric as an excuse to bully or belittle others. (I want to single ou[[t Scott Alexander]] in particular here, who is a nicer person than I am and an increasingly amazing writer on these topics, and may deserve part of the credit for making the culture of *Less Wrong* a healthy one.)

	- More wrote to Luther about “your shitty mouth, truly the shit-pool of all shit, all the muck and shit which your damnable rottenness has vomited up,” and said of Luther’s followers that they “bespatter the most holy image of Christ crucified with the most foul excrement of their bodies” — bodies “destined to be burned.” Luther, for his part, referred to the “dear little ass-pope,” who licks the Devil’s anus, and said of all the popes, “You are desperate thorough arch-rascals, murderers, traitors, liars, the very scum if all the most evil people on earth. You are full of all the worst devils in hell — full, full and so full that you can do nothings but vomit, throw, and blow out devils.”

	- ... Yehuda did not "pass on". Yehuda is not "resting in peace". Yehuda is not coming back. Yehuda doesn't exist any more. Yehuda was absolutely annihilated at the age of nineteen. Yes, that makes me angry. I can't put into words how angry. It would be rage to rend the gates of Heaven and burn down God on Its throne, if any God existed. But there is no God, so my anger burns to tear apart the way-things-are, remake the pattern of a world that permits this....
