- [[The Bible]] [[Job]]
	- Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind:
	- “Who is this that darkens my counsel
	    with words without knowledge?
	  Brace yourself like a man;
	    I will question you,
	    and you shall answer me.
	- “Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation?
	    Tell me, if you understand.
	  Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!
	    Who stretched a measuring line across it?
	  On what were its footings set,
	    or who laid its cornerstone—
	  while the morning stars sang together
	    and all the angels shouted for joy?

	- Despite my mistake, I am happy to say that my readership has so far been amazingly good about *not* using my rhetoric as an excuse to bully or belittle others. (I want to single out Scott Alexander in particular here, who is a nicer person than I am and an increasingly amazing writer on these topics, and may deserve part of the credit for making the culture of *Less Wrong* a healthy one.)
