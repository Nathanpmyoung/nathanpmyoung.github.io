- Probabilities are sometimes divided into
	- Theoretical probabilities - probabilities of idealised examples
		- Heads on a coin
	- Empirical probabilities - probabilities of historical records
		- Head on this coin
		- Getting into a car accident in the next day
	- Subjective probabilies
		- Getting hurt when falling off a bike
- This seems poor
	- Theoretical is fine. But really this just means we define the model
	- Empirical is a red herring - the track record is only relevant under a certain model - what counts as a die, what counts as a car accident
	- Subjective is just a vaguer type of empirical

- How to average probabilities
	- If I am at 50% and you are at 90%, what should I update to given I weight our information the same
