- Good takes
  - Higher education is mainly signalling
  - Voters act rationally within their own interests, properly defined
    - They understand that they are unlikely to accrue the benefits of spending a lot of time thinking about issues, given how unlikely they are to affect the outcome. When they are asked in a way that they will be listened to, they behave differently. [[The Myth of the Rational Voter]]
    - [[Thinking as a leisure activity]]
  - Voters have a number of biases that skew them from the truth, on average
    - Make work bias
    - Xenophobic bias
  - The [[United Arab Emirates]] is underrated
    - Clean
    - Building megastructures
- Bad takes
  - Mental health

  - Veganism
    - I can't remember why Bryan rejects this but I think it's a mistake
