- [[TV]]
- Visually stunning. Some of the most beautiful sci-fi animation I've ever seen.
- Commitment to an alien world. In particular, many creatures and plants work together in surprising ways
- Immersively pretty dead. The characters are like large children, eating and licking things on an alien planet, fighting one another. I struggled to really care about a group of people acting so stupidly.
- Some ways characters were dumb:
	- Not collecting extra resources for travel
	- Not wearing extra layers in a dangerous alien planet
	- Not fashioning weapons
	- Not creating protocols to check for scratches etc
	- Not guarding their valuable resources carefully
- I don't think "It was like a dream" is a good thing for a 12 episode series to be. I am rarely emotionally engaged in a dream.
- A useful counterexample for [[Rational fiction]] in that it seems like something I'd like but ultimately felt thin.
