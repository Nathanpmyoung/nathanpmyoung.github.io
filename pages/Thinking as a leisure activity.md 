- Concept from [[Katja Grace]]
- 
- Consider something people take seriously, like their children or weight loss. They will research a lot to figure out the best option. They probably won't just take your word for it, but they will listen if something seems to have worekd for you. If I have a new tool, some of my tech friends are really interested in it - "oh, what's that?"
- 
- Now consider something people do for leisure, like reading pulpy novels or going for a walk. They aren't tracking this stuff closely. It doesn't matter if a novel doesn't quite make sense of if the trip takes a bit longer than expected. The "Is Diehard a Christmas movie" discussion is a bit, like this. Few poeple actually have done some analysis of thousands of films to find the exact cut off between a Christmas and non-Christmas movie. It's mainly a fun discussion. The things from one discussion don't need to be carefull cached for the future. 
- 
- Which one of these is thinking more like?
- 
- Is thinking generally the careful earnest search for the best option or picking sides, seeing what happens, going with the flow?
-
- I think we might hope it's the first one. And many discussions of discourse seem to take for granted that when people are discussing they are thinking. That when people discuss Trump vs. Harris, they are trying to get to the heart of the matter, and being careful. But.. are they?
-
- Some of you may be familiar with Kanneman's work in [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]. For him there is flighty intuitive system 1 and slow deliberate system 2. Which of those is most of our thinking like?
-
- We've just had an election for the US, the most powerful country in the world. How many people gave the issues one hour of calm peaceful thought in which they wrote down a number of considerations. 1%?
-
- And this isn't some smart vs dumb thing. For the twitter users that spent hours arguing with people. How much of that time was spent with a genuine ability to change their mind. 5%? 
- 
- To me all this looks like supporting a football team. People have their side, they argue for it. But even when they think they are thinking about it, it's still the same thing. 
- 
- I can quite easily think of some situations where I might change my mind. Perhaps I am sitting with friends, with some notes on the topic and my friend Charles says he disagrees. Now Charles is a well-calibrated forecasters and cleverer than me. Generally when we disagree, he's right. If I understand why I think what I think, then I might ask which of my considerations is wrong. If he has a clear answer, more the better.
-
- Alternatively, I might be in a discussion with Katja. Katja's great strength is her weakness at arguing for a side. She can't help but frame things as "oh I wonder why that is". When we discuss I feel much more conscious of when I'm regurgitating a previous position. _What, I wonder why I think that_.
- 
- A third example is that I have the discussion many times across a short period of time, in a well defined way. If I am at a camp where the point of the camp is "discuss whether Ukraine will win the war" over time I imagine I will slowly come to more reasoned views, unable to sustain ones that don't hold up. 
- 
- Most of my discussions are not like these. They aren't with someone who knows much more about a topic, or who encourages me to reconsider my biases or with narrow enough definition for me to let my arguments survive well. 
- 
- Instead they are like the following:
-
- I see a tweet where I know the "strong reply" so I tweet it. They have made a point and I have some sense of which counterpoint works well. In 5 seconds I tweets it and probably wont' return.
- 
- I have a short discussion with someone I don't know in passing and think they are likely wrong. They make some points based on evidence which, if true would be convincing. I don't know where to put the information so I forget it and don't update as much as I could. 
- 
- An issue is being discussed and I feel obliged to take a position on it without giving the thing much thought. I defend part of a position without really considering the whole thing.
-
- In these cases I am often rushed or stressed. Sometimes I have a whole weekend or month of discussions like this. Is this really thinking? Or is it sort of repeating the same errors and expecting things to change. 
- 
- Since Katja mentioned this, I have thought about it a lot. I already had a sense that I should think about fewer things more carefully, but I want to push that further, noticing when I am not in the mood to discuss things well or am just doing so for sport. 
- 
- Secondly I think it surfaces a flaw in me - that while I can be pretty openminded in one sense, I like to use arguments as soldiers with my friends. I don't mind admitting I'm wrong, but even when in discovery mode (sometimes called "Scout Mindset") I am often trying to "defeat" my coscout. I think at times this can hide a defensiveness that stops me from updating more quickly. 
- 
- Takiing this position more generally we might want to consider what kind of thinking our environment encourages? Sure intellecutal sparing is bad, but also it can be bad for people not to know the limit of their energy. 
-
- What do good discussion spaces look like, in my view?
- Safe 
- Focused
- With spare memory or reference materials
- Non-confrontational
