- Consider something people take seriously, like their children or weight loss. They will research a lot to figure out the best option. They probably won't just take your word for it, but they will listen if something seems to have worekd for you.
- 
- Now consider something people do for leisure, like reading pulpy novels or going for a walk. They aren't tracking this stuff closely. It doesn't matter if a novel doesn't quite make sense of if the trip takes a bit longer than expected.
- 
- Which one of these is thinking more like?
- 
- Is thinking generally the careful earnest search for the best option or picking sides, seeing what happens, going with the flow?
-
- Some of you may be familiar with Kanneman's work in [[Thinking, Fast and Slow]]. For him there is flighty intuitive system 1 and slow deliberate system 2. Which of those is most of our thinking like?
-
- We've just had an election for the US, the most powerful country in the world. How many people gave the issues one hour of calm peaceful thought in which they wrote down a number of considerations. 1%?
-
- And this isn't some smart vs dumb thing. For the twitter users that spent hours arguing with people. How much of that time was spent with a genuine ability to change their mind. 5%? 
- 
- To me all this looks like supporting a football team. People have their side, they argue for it. But even when they think they are thinking about it, it's still the same thing.
