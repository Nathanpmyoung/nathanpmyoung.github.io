- What are the effects of decoupling labor and consciousness?

This is the upside of splitting labor and suffering. Might also lead to splitting consciousness and property. In this article I present an alternate frame on AI and control. I'm sure others have noted it. Essentially, my claim is that we have attempted for a long time to decouple consciousness and labor since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. Initially, this was largely about automation. The benefit primarily seems to have been towards capital owners. Workers were expensive and automating them for the same level of drought drove down costs. But also benefits to workers, the median wage went up dramatically. And many unpleasant jobs no longer had to be done. I guess some of this change was deliberate with safety legislation driving up the price of labor. And some may explicitly have been humanitarian, i.e.

In terms of an individual experience of PRO growth. It has mainly felt like many of the worst or most difficult jobs have now been automated with increasingly knowledge work which allows for the highest standing of living and more satisfaction. But the risk is that? increasing separation of labor and consciousness.
