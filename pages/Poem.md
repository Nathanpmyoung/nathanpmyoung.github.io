	  Not a creature was stirring not even the porridge,
	  With all the Grey children asleep in their beds
	  With many a thought in their small clever heads
	  
	  And soon they’d be dreaming of sports and of ventures:
	  The theatre needs plays, the exec need new dentures
	  
	  But before the first somnial trumpet could toot:
	  A fly in the ointment, a snake in the boot
	  For they had no money, those society folks.
	  The rowers weren’t liquid, the Band had no notes..
	  
	  I drifted ‘round Elvet, just churning with gall,
	  Putting this darned magazine on the wall,
	  When out over Grey there arose a commotion,
	  As when awkward new points get raised on a motion.
	  A slow-swelling whisper, t’would surely have shocked ’em 
	  From the south east. Not London!? But Stockton!
	  
	  Dread gripped me, as hearing “Wake up, cleaners please”
	  A red ford fiesta pulled by 10 phoenices,
	  
	  With a spry little driver so lively and gay,
	  I knew in a heartbeat it was Lady Grey.
	  More noble that stags, her eagles they came
	  And she whistled and shouted and called them by name:
	  
	  “Now Neville, now Bronx now Sharp and now Rusty,
	  Now Your Cheap Housemate Whose Clippers Are Trusty
	  On Trampas, Jamal, on Marmaris and Chaps,
	  On All Of The Barbers Not On Google Maps
	  
	  Birds flying’s expected, but the car floated flatly,
	  Plastic can’t fly! (Frisbee club do not @ me)
	  
	  So those fiery rocs, they flew up to Elvet,
	  She won’t land on Oswald unless she can’t help it
	  And faster than boredom I heard from that ceiling
	  The bellows and crackles of phoenices breathing
	  
	  They looked towards Collingwood, clearly dismayed;
	  The birds threw their heads, their mistress some shade.
	  She opened her door and was out in a flash,
	  She was dressed head to toe in Grey exec stash.
	  
	  Her eyes were like steel, to weigh and to study,
	  Her smile never cruel, her cheeks always ruddy,
	  Her short nimble limbs had both power and grace,
	  She had a rouge cloak which blew in her face.
	  Her curly red hair swirled in the breeze,
	  Her moves were on fleek (less of that, please)
	  
	  She laughs with the best, but can still fear rejection
	  She sorts Grey potatoes by proprioception
	  She curtseyed adroitly, she held it until 
	  The college acknowledged, she turned and stood still;
	  
	  A wink of her eye and a twist of her head,
	  Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
	  I opened the window and was openly shocked,
	  By her icy glass ladder, which icily dropped
	  
	  She slid down the ladder like Fireman Sam
	  Like quickly scrolling through one’s Instagram
	  To the quad’s far side door I watched as she strode,
	  She pondered a minute, remembered the code
	  
	  She bust through that portal and went on her route 
	  Giving out pheasants in trees bearing fruit
	  ...Okay, just chocolate, but also good news,
	  For all the Grey children to listen and use
	  
	  Her voice rang like a bell she was louder than Pete,
	  Sweeter than Paddy’s when you’ve nothing to eat
	  “You use finance motions, though who wants to use hust?
	  The Grey Association,The Grey College Trust.
	  
	  But alongside all that there’s one more to plunder
	  I hope you all know, Grey has a crowdfunder!”
	  
	  So back on the roof, her rounds were complete,
	  Her car lifted off with nary a beep,
	  But I heard her exclaim, ‘ere she drove out of sight,
	  A GREY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!
- Theseus and the Minotaur - *I wrote this for [[Dad]]*
  collapsed:: true
	- This tale, which long, but often told,
	  when I was young, was ages old,
	  of fearsome beasts and heroes bold;
	  a maze of stone;
	  a prince, alone;
	  of whitened bones and graves gone cold.
	  
	  The story that I have in store,
	  of Theseus and the Minotaur,
	  is one, no doubt you've heard before.
	  I'll tell in full,
	  not just the bull,
	  before it all was steeped in lore.
	  
	  Asterion: a prince of Crete.
	  At any sport he’d face defeat.
	  But play at chess and he’s elite.
	  He played the court
	  and won. He thought,
	  to call such sport a godly feat.
	  
	  I’ve heard that gods don’t play at dice,
	  but Olympians are known for vice.
	  The boy played Zeus and mated twice.
	  This irked a tad.
	  Zeus was mad.
	  He cursed the lad, it wasn’t nice.
	  
	  The boy was in a hairy phase,
	  with auburn locks oft hard to raze,
	  so wrathful Zeus duly repays,
	  his love of puzzles,
	  with horns and muzzle.
	  The boy is smuggled to a maze.
	  
	  Built by Cretans so I’ve heard.
	  He could escape if he preferred.
	  So with his father had a word.
	  No need for stress,
	  he'd acquiesce
	  if, with chess, he was interred
	  
	  The kid would need a foe to face
	  and soon dad’s fleet was on the case.
	  See Athens burning in disgrace.
	  Hearts were rent,
	  greek youths were sent
	  and long hours spent in two-tone grace.
	  
	  Yet all fourteen he soundly beat
	  and humble pie each had to eat.
	  Those Greeks are proudest in defeat.
	  They sought to die!
	  With each good bye,
	  the bull would cry, with woe replete.
	  
	  Ashamed replies were sent at first
	  and with each year, it just got worse
	  King Minos thought his son a curse.
	  With one cheque mate,
	  deaths might abate,
	  To bring this fate, a plan he nursed,
	  
	  Agaeus was the King of Greece.
	  His princely son gave no release.
	  The boy would talk and never cease.
	  If he lost at chess
	  there’d be distress,
	  but Ageaus would be blessed with peace.
	  
	  King Minos (Crete) was not aligned.
	  His scholars would, the boy refine.
	  The bull would lose, or at least resign.
	  No more deaths,
	  the King could rest,
	  live out his years, invest in wine.
	  
	  Theseus drove the geeks insane!
	  His chess was bad, his voice inane,
	  To Minos then the facts were plain,
	  Just send him in
	  and end the din,
	  lest he begin to talk again.
	  
	  So Theseus walked the darkened maze,
	  adrift inside the stygian haze,
	  Until he lost count of the days.
	  His sock unravelled
	  while he travelled
	  and on the gravel left a trace.
	  
	  And time flowed long and deep, before
	  he found the lonely Minotaur,
	  but when they played his chess was poor.
	  The creature sniffed,
	  slightly miffed,
	  that this rare gift had been a bore.
	  
	  Hellenic pride was not T's style
	  and suicide did not beguile
	  and after talking (for a while)
	  He stood and yawned,
	  reset the board,
	  again explored the chequered tile.
	  
	  The minotaur just kept on winning
	  but found his torment just beginning
	  the monologue was hardly thinning.
	  With passing days
	  he thought of ways
	  to stop this stupid prince’s grinning.
	  
	  Day twelve his patience loudly broke,
	  The caustic prince he tried to choke,
	  but Theseus, a muscly bloke
	  thrust out a pawn
	  with all his brawn
	  and killed the faun, with just one stroke.
	  
	  And so Asterion there died
	  and likely Theseus by his side,
	  but luckily the gods supplied
	  flight from the Rock
	  that thread of sock.
	  Our jock took stock, and then complied. 
	  
	  A week later proud, he left the cave.
	  The princess thought him strong and brave.
	  "There wedding must not be delayed,"
	  Minos expressed.
	  For speed was best,
	  lest he be left, with boring knave.
	  
	  And so the lovers sailed away.
	  His wife swam off within a day,
	  too tired from all he had to say.
	  When his father learned,
	  that he’d returned,
	  He threw himself into the bay.
	  
	  And so one learns from such as this,
	  the tales we tell are often priss;
	  many parts are changed or missed.
	  And to fail at chess
	  Is no distress
	  If you can best them with your fists.

  collapsed:: true
	- I love you
	  so I will never see you again
	  I will not send you messages
	  Idly hoping for you to change your mind
	  I will not try to bump into you at train stations
	  Or near your house
	  I will not try to become better
	  To get big muscles so one day you can be impressed
	  Or to become prime minister 
	  So you are forced to say "I knew him once"
	  I will live my life as if you do not exist
	  I will become more beautiful for me
	  Not as some tawdry push
	  I love you
	  But I also love me
	  So this must end
	  As if it had never began
- Monster
	- *I guess I wrote this, I have a load of notes for it, but I don't remember it at all*
	- We are a normal family,
	  A father and a mother,
	  I have a little sister,
	  I have a little brother.
	  
	  But we have a curious secret,
	  Something quite bizarre,
	  Someone lives inside our house,
	  You not guess what they are
	  
	  He is the food devourer,
	  Eating leftovers with haste,
	  If something’s to be wasted,
	  It goes straight to his waist.
	  
	  He snacks tuesday’s luncheon,
	  He’ll munch on thursday’s tea,
	  If it’s chilling in the fridge,
	  He’ll eat that food for free.
	  
	  Sometimes my babysitter,
	  My nanny or my driver,
	  When mum and dad got out,
	  He won’t even get a fiver
	  
	  We sometimes play at monsters,
	  At mermaids or at tigers,
	  When we lead the army
	  There are no survivors.
	  
	  He has his friends to dinner,
	  He goes to work in rain,
	  His room is really messy,
	  But dad does not complain.
	  
	  One day two people visited,
	  I was shocked it’s true,
	  I’d never considered,
	  He has parents too,
	  
	  He’s kind of like a brother,
	  He’s kind of like a friend,
	  He’s technically our lodger,
	  But that is not the end.
	  
	  He’s really just a person
	  Who wants not to live alone,
	  So he’s in our family,
	  Cos he doesn’t have his own.
- Rowing
  collapsed:: true
	- Sometime when it’s windy we go rowing in the rain,
	  Four frozen freshers vainly vying for some semblance that they’re sane,
	  Nervous knee high waves encroaching on the boundaries of our boat,
	  With our bow side Archimedes calculating if we’ll float,
	  
	  I’m either worrying that I’m hurrying or my blade is feeling slack,
	  As our cox’s desperate voxings take the long way to the back.
	  Sternly, I’m reminded, that we should all row together,
	  For four oars are in our hands, despite the sailing kind of weather,
	  
	  The the group catches in unison, and I’m shock that we’re so fast,
	  Hardy feel the hypothermia, as the uni flashes past,
	  Now no inkling of our sinking as we slide across the top,
	  Unless we vent all our momentum in a sodden, sudden stop.
- Christmas
  collapsed:: true
	- If Christmas were a particle,
	  Which one would it be?
	  Though maybe quirks instead of quarks,
	  And rather more than three,
	  It seems to have a purpose,
	  And if you’re Catholic, mass,
	  One you find its presents,
	  Uncertainty is crass,
	  I’m sure that it is positive,
	  And also fundamental,
	  Spanning all of space and time,
	  Its value, transcendental,
	  You need no strange devices,
	  Just your family will do,
	  Learn to love one another,
	  Give a present to your brother,
	  And collapse a waveform or two.

- Robinson Crusoe's Story by [[Charles Carryl]]
  collapsed:: true
	- *I love this poem because it was in a big book of silly poems that my [[Dad]] read to me as a child. He sang it to a tune and it was great.*
	- THE night was thick and hazy
	  When the 'Piccadilly Daisy'
	  Carried down the crew and captain in the sea;
	  And I think the water drowned 'em;
	  For they never, never found 'em,
	  And I know they didn't come ashore with me.
	- Oh! 'twas very sad and lonely
	  When I found myself the only
	  Population on this cultivated shore;
	  But I've made a little tavern
	  In a rocky little cavern,
	  And I sit and watch for people at the door.
	- I spent no time in looking
	  For a girl to do my cooking,
	  As I'm quite a clever hand at making stews;
	  But I had that fellow Friday,
	  Just to keep the tavern tidy,
	  And to put a Sunday polish on my shoes.
	- I have a little garden
	  That I'm cultivating lard in,
	  As the things I eat are rather tough and dry;
	  For I live on toasted lizards,
	  Prickly pears, and parrot gizzards,
	  And I'm really very fond of beetle-pie.
	- The clothes I had were furry,
	  And it made me fret and worry
	  When I found the moths were eating off the hair;
	  And I had to scrape and sand 'em,
	  And I boiled 'em and I tanned 'em,
	  Till I got the fine morocco suit I wear.
	- I sometimes seek diversion
	  In a family excursion
	  With the few domestic animals you see;
	  And we take along a carrot
	  As refreshment for the parrot,
	  And a little can of jungleberry tea.
	- Then we gather as we travel,
	  Bits of moss and dirty gravel,
	  And we chip off little specimens of stone;
	  And we carry home as prizes
	  Funny bugs, of handy sizes,
	  Just to give the day a scientific tone.
	- If the roads are wet and muddy
	  We remain at home and study,—
	  For the Goat is very clever at a sum,—
	  And the Dog, instead of fighting,
	  Studies ornamental writing,
	  While the Cat is taking lessons on the drum.
	- We retire at eleven,
	  And we rise again at seven;
	  And I wish to call attention, as I close,
	  To the fact that all the scholars
	  Are correct about their collars,
	  And particular in turning out their toes.
- [As you know yourself](https://allpoetry.com/poem/14796670-As-you-know-yourself-by-Katja-Grace) by [[Katja Grace]]
	- Don’t look upon the light in your eyes, look upon the sky.
	  And don’t feel the pain in your side, feel the wound there.
	  And as you ride over the stony ground, don’t touch the shaking seat, touch each stone with your wheels.
	  Then feel your soft body of dirt, with tires reeling over you, and solid stone beneath, the cool metal of your lampposts and the cement of your gutters.
	  Don’t feel me move to a hidden force beneath your hand, feel the force with my body, your hand. Don’t hear my words, hear the roughness and warmth of my mind. Meet me here, face to face.
