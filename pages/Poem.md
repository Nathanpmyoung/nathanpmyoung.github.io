	  Not a creature was stirring not even the porridge,
	  With all the Grey children asleep in their beds
	  With many a thought in their small clever heads
	  
	  And soon they’d be dreaming of sports and of ventures:
	  The theatre needs plays, the exec need new dentures
	  
	  But before the first somnial trumpet could toot:
	  A fly in the ointment, a snake in the boot
	  For they had no money, those society folks.
	  The rowers weren’t liquid, the Band had no notes..
	  
	  I drifted ‘round Elvet, just churning with gall,
	  Putting this darned magazine on the wall,
	  When out over Grey there arose a commotion,
	  As when awkward new points get raised on a motion.
	  A slow-swelling whisper, t’would surely have shocked ’em 
	  From the south east. Not London!? But Stockton!
	  
	  Dread gripped me, as hearing “Wake up, cleaners please”
	  A red ford fiesta pulled by 10 phoenices,
	  
	  With a spry little driver so lively and gay,
	  I knew in a heartbeat it was Lady Grey.
	  More noble that stags, her eagles they came
	  And she whistled and shouted and called them by name:
	  
	  “Now Neville, now Bronx now Sharp and now Rusty,
	  Now Your Cheap Housemate Whose Clippers Are Trusty
	  On Trampas, Jamal, on Marmaris and Chaps,
	  On All Of The Barbers Not On Google Maps
	  
	  Birds flying’s expected, but the car floated flatly,
	  Plastic can’t fly! (Frisbee club do not @ me)
	  
	  So those fiery rocs, they flew up to Elvet,
	  She won’t land on Oswald unless she can’t help it
	  And faster than boredom I heard from that ceiling
	  The bellows and crackles of phoenices breathing
	  
	  They looked towards Collingwood, clearly dismayed;
	  The birds threw their heads, their mistress some shade.
	  She opened her door and was out in a flash,
	  She was dressed head to toe in Grey exec stash.
	  
	  Her eyes were like steel, to weigh and to study,
	  Her smile never cruel, her cheeks always ruddy,
	  Her short nimble limbs had both power and grace,
	  She had a rouge cloak which blew in her face.
	  Her curly red hair swirled in the breeze,
	  Her moves were on fleek (less of that, please)
	  
	  She laughs with the best, but can still fear rejection
	  She sorts Grey potatoes by proprioception
	  She curtseyed adroitly, she held it until 
	  The college acknowledged, she turned and stood still;
	  
	  A wink of her eye and a twist of her head,
	  Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
	  I opened the window and was openly shocked,
	  By her icy glass ladder, which icily dropped
	  
	  She slid down the ladder like Fireman Sam
	  Like quickly scrolling through one’s Instagram
	  To the quad’s far side door I watched as she strode,
	  She pondered a minute, remembered the code
	  
	  She bust through that portal and went on her route 
	  Giving out pheasants in trees bearing fruit
	  ...Okay, just chocolate, but also good news,
	  For all the Grey children to listen and use
	  
	  Her voice rang like a bell she was louder than Pete,
	  Sweeter than Paddy’s when you’ve nothing to eat
	  “You use finance motions, though who wants to use hust?
	  The Grey Association,The Grey College Trust.
	  
	  But alongside all that there’s one more to plunder
	  I hope you all know, Grey has a crowdfunder!”
	  
	  So back on the roof, her rounds were complete,
	  Her car lifted off with nary a beep,
	  But I heard her exclaim, ‘ere she drove out of sight,
	  A GREY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!
- Theseus and the Minotaur - *I wrote this for [[Dad]]*
  collapsed:: true
	- This tale which long, but often told,
	  When I was young, was ages old,
	  Of fearsome beasts and heroes bold,
	  A maze of stone,
	  A prince, alone,
	  Of whitened bones and graves gone cold,
	  
	  The story that I have in store,
	  Of Theseus and Minotaur,
	  One you’ve no doubt heard before,
	  The tale in full,
	  Not just the bull,
	  Before it all was steeped in lore.
	  
	  Asterion, a prince of Crete,
	  At any sport he’d face defeat
	  But bring a board and he’s elite,
	  He played the court
	  And won. He thought,
	  To call such sport a godly feat
	  
	  I’ve heard that gods don’t play at dice
	  But Olympians are known for vice
	  The boy played Zeus and beat him twice
	  This irked a tad,
	  And Zeus was mad,
	  He cursed the lad, it wasn’t nice
	  
	  The boy was in a hairy phase,
	  With auburn locks oft hard to raze
	  And wrathful Zeus duly repays
	  His love of puzzles
	  Horns and a muzzle
	  The boy is hidden in the maze
	  
	  Built by Cretans so I’ve heard
	  So easy’s to be thought absurd
	  And with his father had a word
	  A game of chess
	  Would solve the mess
	  And calm the stress that he’d incurred
	  
	  But he would need a foe to face
	  And soon dad’s fleet was on the case
	  With Athens burning in disgrace
	  Hearts were rent
	  Greek youths were sent
	  And time was spent in two tone grace
	  
	  So all fourteen he soundly beat
	  And humble pie each had to eat
	  But Greeks are proudest in defeat
	  They sought to die
	  With each good by
	  The bull would cry with woe replete.
	  
	  Ashamed replies were sent at first
	  And with each year it just got worse
	  King Minos thought his son a curse
	  With one cheque mate,
	  Deaths might abate,
	  To cause this fate a plan he nursed,
	  
	  Agaeus was the King of Greece
	  His princely son gave no release,
	  The boy would talk and never cease,
	  If he lost at chess
	  There’d be distress
	  But he would then be blessed with peace 
	  
	  But Minos had his own design
	  Dedalus, would, the boy, refine
	  The bull would lose and they’d be fine
	  No more deaths
	  And he could rest 
	  His interests would soon align
	  
	  But Theseus drove them all insane
	  His chess was bad, his voice inane
	  And Minos decided it was plain
	  Just send him in
	  And end the din
	  Lest he begin to talk again.
	  
	  And so he walked the darkened maze
	  Adrift inside the stygian haze
	  Until he lost count of the days
	  His sock unravelled
	  While he travelled
	  And on the gravel left a trace
	  
	  And time flowed long and deep, before
	  He found the lonely Minotaur
	  But when he played his chess was poor,
	  The creature sniffed
	  Slightly miffed
	  That this rare gift had been a bore
	  
	  Helenic pride was not his style
	  And suicide did not beguile
	  And after talking for a while
	  Stepped toward
	  Reset the board
	  Again explored the chequered tile
	  
	  The minotaur just kept on winning
	  And found his torment just beginning
	  The monologue was hardly thinning
	  With passing days
	  He thought of ways
	  To stop this stupid prince’s grinning
	  
	  So finally his patience broke
	  The caustic prince he tried to choke
	  But Theseus, a muscly bloke
	  Thrust out a pawn
	  With all his brawn
	  And killed the faun with just one stroke
	  
	  And so Asterion there died
	  And the price would there reside
	  But luckily the gods supplied
	  Flight from the rock
	  That thread of sock
	  Despite his shock he quickly managed to decide
	  
	  And so he proudly left the cave
	  The princess thought him strong and brave
	  Minos her hand in marriage gave
	  At his behest
	  Speed was best
	  Or he be left, with boring knave
	  
	  And so the lovers sailed away
	  His wife swam off within a day
	  Too tired from all the Prince would say
	  When his father learned
	  That he’d returned
	  Death he yearned and threw himself into the bay
	  
	  And so one learns from such as this
	  The tales we tell are often priss
	  Many parts are changed or missed
	  And to fail at chess
	  Is no distress
	  As long as you’re best with your fists
