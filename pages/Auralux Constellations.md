- Auralux is a good [[Game]]
	- I have played it more than many games
	- It's easy enough to faff about on but hard enough to come back to
	- It is very simple in terms of UX - there is one type of unit and one upgrade path
	- It is visually pleasing
- But it feels pretty flawed
	- There are no marginal changes. It seems to me at least that at any point it's as good to do any upgrade or landgrab as any other.
	- Likewise All troops have the same abilities and last an infinite time
- Some suggestions
	- Subsequent levels of a star cost more resources than their increase in production rate
	- Destroying a star is easier than the cost it takes to create
	- Troops die over time
	- Troops gain a defensive bonus when around a star/certain types of star
	- Some stars produce ranged troops
