		- Artificial general intelligence (AGI) refers to the hypothetical intelligence of a machine that possesses the ability to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. It is a type of [artificial intelligence](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence)(AI) that aims to mimic the cognitive abilities of the human brain.

		- Sometimes known as general AI, strong AI or broad AI**, **this often refers to a theoretical form of AI that can achieve [human-level or higher performance](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/653bc393d10f3500139a6ac5/future-risks-of-frontier-ai-annex-a.pdf) across most cognitive tasks. See also Superintelligence.

		- Artificial general intelligence (AGI) is a hypothetical stage in the development of [machine learning](https://www.ibm.com/topics/machine-learning) (ML) in which an artificial intelligence (AI) system can match or exceed the cognitive abilities of human beings across any task. It represents the fundamental, abstract goal of [AI](https://www.ibm.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) development: the artificial replication of human intelligence in a machine or software.

		- **Artificial general intelligence** (**AGI**) is a type of [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) (AI) that matches or surpasses human cognitive capabilities across a wide range of cognitive tasks. This contrasts with [narrow AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrow_AI), which is limited to specific tasks.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence#cite_note-1) [Artificial superintelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_superintelligence) (ASI), on the other hand, refers to AGI that greatly exceeds human cognitive capabilities. AGI is considered one of the definitions of [strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI_(disambiguation)).
