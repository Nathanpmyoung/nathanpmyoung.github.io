  -I got some parchment that I'm grippin', animal skin for the scriptin'
  Medieval monks in the kitchen, preparing hides with precision
  Scraping and stretching and fixing, calcium-treated addition
  Surface so smooth for inscription, centuries lasting tradition
  Calfskin and goatskin decisions, choosing the best for the mission
  Thin as a page but resistant, writing surface with definition
  Permanent ink that's persisting, manuscript art with ambition
  Heritage kept in condition, knowledge through time's opposition
  Vellum!
  Ancient craft that we're lifting
  Sacred texts that we're gifting
  Stories passed through the ages
  Written down on these pages
  Vellum!
  Durable, lasting forever
  Through all kinds of weather
  Premium grade for the crown
  Words that won't break down
  Preparing the hide with the lime
  Drying it out for a time
  Smoothing until it's sublime
  Ready to carry the rhyme
  Every piece unique design
  Quality you can define
  Legacy written in lines
  History that we preserve
  Culture that we deserve
  Vellum!
- ChatGPT's attempt
- [Intro]

Got a page filled with ink for the skilled quill
They say the scroll's sealed, but I still will
Reveal the real deal, let the words spill
Ancient scripts, my grip tight, I write till

Vellum—gonna tell 'em that I pen 'em
Words eternal on the page, I send 'em
Through the ages, sages commend 'em
From the past to the present, we defend 'em

[Verse 1]

In the scriptorium, I'm laboring, engraving
Lines on calfskin, my task's been amazing
Cursive curves, every word's worth saving
Illuminated letters, better than engraving

They say the medium is old, but it holds gold
Stories untold unfold as the scroll rolls
Preserving wisdom, the kingdom of old souls
Embedded in the vellum, we propel 'em, the world knows

[Chorus]

Vellum—gonna tell 'em that I pen 'em
Words eternal on the page, I send 'em
Through the ages, sages commend 'em
From the past to the present, we defend 'em

[Verse 2]

From monasteries to libraries, we carry
The torch of knowledge, abolish the arbitrary
Every manuscript, a gift, we lift barriers
Transmitting scripts, eclipse the adversaries

Parchment's parchment, but this is art sent
From the heart, bent on leaving an imprint
Indelible, credible, it's legible evidence
Of heritage, we inherit the intelligence

[Chorus]

Vellum—gonna tell 'em that I pen 'em
Words eternal on the page, I send 'em
Through the ages, sages commend 'em
From the past to the present, we defend 'em

[Bridge]

Ink flows, the quill knows where the soul goes
On this canvas, we plant seeds that grow
Echoes of echoes, in margins we compose
A legacy etched, stretched across the globe

[Chorus]

Vellum—gonna tell 'em that I pen 'em
Words eternal on the page, I send 'em
Through the ages, sages commend 'em
From the past to the present, we defend 'em

[Outro]

So when the world spins and the words thin
Look within the vellum, where the verse wins
Preserve hymns, the ink blends, the tale ends
But the message lives on in the vellum skins
