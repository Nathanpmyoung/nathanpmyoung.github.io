- I have felt embarrassed a lot. I am a large, charismatic, clumsy, overly analytical, self-involved person. This has presented many many occasions of public embarrassment, both by being wrong about something and by being clumsy in a public place:
	- I have while running, fallen twice in public, in front of people I wanted to respect me - once in front of my whole year at school attempting to jump onto the stage. Once on the university open day during a treasure hunt.
	- Once, at camp, there was a very cool guy named "Mango". His name, was not, as I recalled while mentioning him in front of the whole group, "Melon".
- Embarrassment is an unpleasant emotion, but it links to being the centre of attention and submission, both of which can be pleasant. I can understand why some people become class clowns. And there is a slight rosy glow around many of these stories, though they also mortify me.
- Notably I don't feel this around embarrassment around bad behaviour, but I wonder if some do. I don't desire to push into it, but I imagine I could feel this.
- When I consider returning to [[Christianity]] I feel this embarrassment/enjoyment combo. I would have to say I was wrong to almost everyone I respect. But in some sense I find this high status as well as low status.
