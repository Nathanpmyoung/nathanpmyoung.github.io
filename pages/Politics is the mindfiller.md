- There are many things to care about and most of us aren't good at thinking about all of them
- Politics has many many such things.
- Do you know about
  - Crime stats
  - Energy generation
  - Hiring law
  - University entrance
  - Politicians' political beliefs
  - Politicians' personal lives
  - Healthcare
  - Immigration
- And for all of these do you have a surface level $100 understanding? Or can you actually confidently think that things you say are actually the case.
- Poltics may or may not be the mindkiller, whatever Yud meant by that, but for me it is the mindfiller, it's just a huge amount of work to stay on top of.
- It would be healthier for me to focus on a few areas and then say I don't know about the rest.
