	- Demeisen lies to Veppers in saying that he won't come to harm from him or Ledegia. I sense minds should use [[Functional Decision Theory]] and so they should want to be able to be trusted to make deals even if they would later want to break them. Hence he should be able to make a deal that would bind him.
