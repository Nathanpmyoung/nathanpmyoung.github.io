	- Presidential Debate
	- The resolution criteria was GPT 4o in a week's time (when hopefully fact checks have been written)

	- Takeaway
		- Factchecking was fun but frenetic
		- The factchecking itself didn't feel that valuable
		- The graph feels good. If it were trustworthy it would feel better
		- Perhaps [[Community Notes]] should score what % of people's posts get noted
