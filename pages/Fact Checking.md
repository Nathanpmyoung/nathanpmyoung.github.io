- v1
	- Presidential Debate
	- The resolution criteria was GPT 4o in a week's time (when hopefully fact checks have been written)
	- People could add statements as markets. I and a friend did
	- People then bet on their expectation of the resolution
	- Made a graph

	- Takeaway
		- Factchecking was fun but frenetic
		- The factchecking itself didn't feel that valuable
		- The graph feels good. If it were trustworthy it would feel better
		- Perhaps [[Community Notes]] should score what % of people's posts get noted
- v2
	- Have this graph as the top of a website
	- Anyone can submit statements
	- Others can add context and vote on them, as per community notes
		- Does this require X login to work?
		- How do we know how different people are so as to do the clustering?
	- Get 10 people to say they'll use the site while the debate is happening
	- Others use it and vote
	- There is a median of votes for each candidate
