- Notes from the Curve, a conference trying to create good discourse around AI
- Different from other conferences
  - Rather than meeting of a tribe or cluster of tribes around shared idea, it was two conflicting tribes
  - I would like to see more events like this
- Connections made
  - Best part was people making friends across different tribes
  - Great conversations with @deanwball and @elidourado
  - ht @mishagloubermaz for this point
- Event organization
  - Run by Rachel Weinberg
  - Real value will come from running 10-100 events and seeing improvement
  - Hope for future funding
  - Organizers (Rachel, Anna, @akrolsmir) focused on good discourse:
    - Only invited people of good faith
    - Good balance between pro and anti-regulation factions
    - Many experimental choices
- Debates
  - Ran 2 debates
  - Current theory: people defend status more than they realize
  - No one wants to look wrong in front of crowd (especially men)
  - Goal: create low stress environment for navigating different opinions
  - Thanks to @KatjaGrace and Rebecca for thoughts
- Venue
  - Lighthaven is great space
  - Recommended for Berkeley/SF conferences
  - Managed by @RatOrthodox

- Mind-changing moments
  - The marginal bill
    - @elidourado: Consider bills in context of other bills
    - Many AI bills may slow AI without improving safety
  - The median isn't the message
    - UK weather example: 100% say overcast but all know sun is possible
    - AI discussions focus on median outcomes, miss shared views
  - Economic models
    - Economists not backing own growth models
    - If AI automates thinking, should see returns from scale
  - Process complexity
    - @elidourado on AGI 2027 timeline
    - Many bottlenecks: systems, regulation, unforeseen problems
    - X-risk severity justifies regulation even with low probability
  - Theory vs practice
    - @deanwball: Legal system will slow AI significantly
    - Neat mechanisms may not survive US government
  - Liability issues
    - @ketanr: Strict liability puts negative externalities on AI companies
    - Companies don't capture all positive externalities
    - @gabriel_weil and @deanwball: Insurance markets valuable
    - Question: What exactly would insurers insure against?
- Building trust
  - Anti-regulation side's distrust of "last bill" promises
  - Mechanisms to build trust:
    - Friendship
    - Betting on outcomes
    - Sunset and sunrise provisions
- Conclusion
  - Too early to judge success
  - Grateful to Rachel Weinberg and team
  - Hope for more cross-divide conferences
